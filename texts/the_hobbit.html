<p>In this reprint several minor inaccuracies, most of them noted by readers,
have been corrected. For example, the text on pages 32 and 62 now corresponds
exactly with the runes on Thror's Map. More important is the matter of <i>Chapter
Five</i>. There the true story of the ending of the Riddle Game, as it was
eventually revealed (under pressure) by Bilbo to Gandalf, is now given according
to the Red Book, in place of the version Bilbo first gave to his friends, and
actually set down in his diary. This departure from truth on the part of a most
honest hobbit was a portent of great significance. It does not, however, concern
the present story, and those who in this edition make their first acquaintance
with hobbit-lore need not troupe about it. Its explanation lies in the history
of the Ring, as it was set out in the chronicles of <b>the Red Book of Westmarch</b>,
and is now told in <b>The Lord of the Rings</b>.</p>
<p>A final note may be added, on a point raised by several students of the lore
of the period. On Thror's Map is written Here of old was Thrain King under the
Mountain; yet Thrain was the son of Thror, the last King under the Mountain
before the coming of the dragon. The Map, however, is not in error. Names are
often repeated in dynasties, and the genealogies show that a distant ancestor of
Thror was referred to, Thrain I, a fugitive from Moria, who first discovered the
Lonely Mountain, Erebor, and ruled there for a while, before his people moved on
to the remoter mountains of the North.</p>

<h2>Chapter I</h2>
<h2>An Unexpected Party</h2>
<p>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole,
filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole
with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that
means comfort.</p>
<p>It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny
yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall
like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and
floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of
pegs for hats and coats - the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on
and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill - The
Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it - and many little round
doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs
for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these),
wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all
were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all
on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows,
deep-set round windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down
to the river.</p>
<p>This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The
Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and
people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were
rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected:
you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of
asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, found himself
doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours'
respect, but he gained-well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.</p>
<p>The mother of our particular hobbit … what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits
need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big
People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our
height, and smaller than the bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is
little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps
them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me
come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile
off. They are inclined to be at in the stomach; they dress in bright colours
(chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural
leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is
curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep
fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they
can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of
this hobbit - of Bilbo Baggins, that is - was the fabulous Belladonna Took, one
of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived
across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often
said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken
a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still
something not entirely hobbit-like about them, - and once in a while members of
the Took-clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and the
family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as
respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer. Not that
Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins.
Bungo, that was Bilbo's father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her
(and partly with her money) that was to be found either under The Hill or over
The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to the end of their days.
Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved
exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something
a bit queer in his makeup from the Took side, something that only waited for a
chance to come out. The chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up,
being about fifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built
by his father, which I have just described for you, until he had in fact
apparently settled down immovably.</p>
<p>By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when
there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and
prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking
an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly
brushed) - Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I
have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear,
you would be prepared for any sort I of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures
sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary
fashion. He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not
since his friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost
forgotten what he looked like. He had been away over The Hill and across The
Water on business of his own since they were all small hobbit-boys and
hobbit-girls.</p>
<p>All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff.
He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a
white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.</p>
<p>"Good morning!" said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining,
and the grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy
eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat. "What do
you mean?" he said. "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is
a good morning whether I want not; or that you feel good this morning; or that
it is morning to be good on?"</p>
<p>"All of them at once," said Bilbo. "And a very fine morning
for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about
you, sit down and have a fill of mine! There's no hurry, we have all the day
before us!" Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs,
and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without
breaking and floated away over The Hill.</p>
<p>"Very pretty!" said Gandalf. "But I have no time to blow
smoke-rings this morning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that
I am arranging, and it's very difficult to find anyone."</p>
<p>“I should think so - in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no
use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for
dinner! I can’t think what anybody sees in them,” said our Mr. Baggins, and
stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smoke-ring.
Then he took out his morning letters, and begin to read, pretending to take no
more notice of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and
wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his
stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite
uncomfortable and even a little cross.</p>
<p>"Good morning!" he said at last. "We don't want any adventures
here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water." By this
he meant that the conversation was at an end.</p>
<p>"What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!" said Gandalf.
"Now you mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good
till I move off."</p>
<p>"Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don't think I know
your name?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, my dear sir - and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And
you do know my name, though you don't remember that I belong to it. I am
Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I should have lived to be
good-morninged by Belladonna Took's son, as if I was selling buttons at the
door!"</p>
<p>"Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave
Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came
undone till ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at
parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and
the unexpected luck of widows' sons? Not the man that used to make such
particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them
on Midsummer's Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and
snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!"
You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to
believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. "Dear me!" he went on.
"Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses
going off into the Blue for mad adventures. Anything from climbing trees to
visiting Elves - or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life
used to be quite inter - I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts
once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in
business."</p>
<p>"Where else should I be?" said the wizard. "All the same I am
pleased to find you remember something about me. You seem to remember my
fireworks kindly, at any rate, land that is not without hope. Indeed for your
old grand-father Took's sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give
you what you asked for."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, I haven't asked for anything!"</p>
<p>"Yes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go
so far as to send you on this adventure. Very amusing for me, very good for you
and profitable too, very likely, if you ever get over it."</p>
<p>"Sorry! I don't want any adventures, thank you. Not today. Good morning!
But please come to tea - any time you like! Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow!
Good-bye!"</p>
<p>With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door, and
shut it as quickly as he dared, not to seen rude. Wizards after all are wizards.</p>
<p>"What on earth did I ask him to tea for!" he said to him-self, as
he went to the pantry. He had only just had break fast, but he thought a cake or
two and a drink of something would do him good after his fright. Gandalf in the
meantime was still standing outside the door, and laughing long but quietly.
After a while he stepped up, and with the spike of his staff scratched a queer
sign on the hobbit's beautiful green front-door. Then he strode away, just about
the time when Bilbo was finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he
had escape adventures very well.</p>
<p>The next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf. He did not remember
things very well, unless he put them down on his Engagement Tablet: like this: <i>Gandalf
Tea Wednesday</i>. Yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of the
kind. Just before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell,
and then he remembered! He rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup
and saucer and an extra cake or two, and ran to the door.</p>
<p>"I am so sorry to keep you waiting!" he was going to say, when he
saw that it was not Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into
a golden belt, and very bright eyes under his dark-green hood. As soon a the
door was opened, he pushed inside, just as if he had been expected.</p>
<p>He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and "Dwalin at your
service!" he said with a low bow.</p>
<p>"Bilbo Baggins at yours!" said the hobbit, too surprised to ask any
questions for the moment. When the silence that followed had become
uncomfortable, he added: "I am just about to take tea; pray come and have
some with me." A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what
would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall
without a word of explanation?</p>
<p>They had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third
cake, when there came another even louder ring at the bell.</p>
<p>"Excuse me!" said the hobbit, and off he went to the door.</p>
<p>"So you have got here at last!" was what he was going to say to
Gandalf this time. But it was not Gandalf. Instead there was a very old-looking
dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped
inside as soon as the door was open, just as if he had been invited.</p>
<p>"I see they have begun to arrive already," he said when he caught
sight of Dwalin's green hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it, and
"Balin at your service!" he said with his hand on his breast.</p>
<p>"Thank you!" said Bilbo with a gasp. It was not the correct thing
to say, but they have begun to arrive had flustered him badly. He liked
visitors, but he liked to know them before they arrived, and he preferred to ask
them himself. He had a horrible thought that the cakes might run short, and then
he-as the host: he knew his duty and stuck to it however painful-he might have
to go without.</p>
<p>"Come along in, and have some tea!" he managed to say after taking
a deep breath.</p>
<p>"A little beer would suit me better, if it is all the same to you, my
good sir," said Balin with the white beard. "But I don't mind some
cake-seed-cake, if you have any."</p>
<p>"Lots!" Bilbo found himself answering, to his own surprise; and he
found himself scuttling off, too, to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and to
the pantry to fetch two beautiful round seed-cakes which he had baked that
afternoon for his after-supper morsel.</p>
<p>When he got back Balin and Dwalin were talking at the table like old friends
(as a matter of fact they were brothers). Bilbo plumped down the beer and the
cake in front of them, when loud came a ring at the bell again, and then another
ring.</p>
<p>"Gandalf for certain this time," he thought as he puffed along the
passage. But it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver
belts, and yellow beards; and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade.
In they hopped, as soon as the door began to open-Bilbo was hardly surprised at
all.</p>
<p>"What can I do for you, my dwarves?" he said. "Kili at your
service!" said the one. "And Fili!" added the other; and they
both swept off their blue hoods and bowed.</p>
<p>"At yours and your family's!" replied Bilbo, remembering his
manners this time.</p>
<p>"Dwalin and Balin here already, I see," said Kili. "Let us
join the throng!"</p>
<p>"Throng!" thought Mr. Baggins. "I don't like the sound of
that. I really must sit down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a
drink." He had only just had a sip-in the corner, while the four dwarves
sat around the table, and talked about mines and gold and troubles with the
goblins, and the depredations of dragons, and lots of other things which he did
not understand, and did not want to, for they sounded much too adventurous-when,
ding-dong-a-ling-' dang, his bell rang again, as if some naughty little
hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. "Someone at the door!"
he said, blinking. "Some four, I should say by the sound," said Fili.
"Be-sides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance."</p>
<p>The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands,
and wondered what had happened, and what was going to happen, and whether they
would all stay to supper. Then the bell rang again louder than ever, and he had
to run to the door. It was not four after all, t was FIVE. Another dwarf had
come along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob,
be-x)re they were all inside, bowing and saying "at your service" one
after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were their names; and very soon
two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on
the pegs, and off they marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and
silver belts to join the others. Already it had almost become a throng. Some
called for ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee, and all of them for
cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while.</p>
<p>A big jug of coffee bad just been set in the hearth, the seed-cakes were
gone, and the dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones, when there
came-a loud knock. Not a ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit's beautiful
green door. Somebody was banging with a stick!</p>
<p>Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and altogether bewildered and
bewuthered-this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled
open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More
dwarves, four more! And there was Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and
laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the
way, knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before.</p>
<p>"Carefully! Carefully!" he said. "It is not like you, Bilbo,
to keep friends waiting on the mat, and then open the door like a pop-gun! Let
me introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!"</p>
<p>"At your service!" said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row.
Then they hung up two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one
with a long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important
dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself, who was not
at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on
top of him. For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was
very haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was
sorry so many times, that at last he grunted "pray don't mention it,"
and stopped frowning.</p>
<p>"Now we are all here!" said Gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen
hoods-the best detachable party hoods-and his own hat hanging on the pegs.
"Quite a merry gathering!</p>
<p>I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What's
that? Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think, for me." "And for
me," said Thorin. "And raspberry jam and apple-tart," said Bifur.
"And mince-pies and cheese," said Bofur. "And pork-pie and
salad," said Bombur. "And more cakes-and ale-and coffee, if you don't
mind," called the other dwarves through the door.</p>
<p>"Put on a few eggs, there's a good fellow!" Gandalf called after
him, as the hobbit stumped off to the pantries. "And just bring out the
cold chicken and pickles!"</p>
<p>"Seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as I do
myself!" thought Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, and was
beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into
his house. By the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and
forks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, he was
getting very hot, and red in the face, and annoyed.</p>
<p>"Confusticate and bebother these dwarves!" he said aloud. "Why
don't they come and lend a hand?" Lo and behold! there stood Balin and
Dwalin at the door of the kitchen, and Fili and Kili behind them, and before he
could say knife they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the
parlour and set out everything afresh.</p>
<p>Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen, dwarves all round:
and Bilbo sat on a stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite
was quite taken away), and trying to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary
and. not in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and
talked, and time got on. At last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a
move to collect the plates and glasses.</p>
<p>"I suppose you will all stay to supper?" he said in his politest
unpressing tones. "Of course!" said Thorin. "And after. We shan't
get through the business till late, and we must have some music first. Now to
clear up!"</p>
<p>Thereupon the twelve dwarves-not Thorin, he was too important, and stayed
talking to Gandalf-jumped to their feet and made tall piles of all the things.
Off they went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a
bottle on the top, with one hand, while the hobbit ran after them almost
squeaking with fright: "please be careful!" and "please, don't
trouble! I can manage." But the dwarves only started to sing:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Chip the glasses and crack the plates!</p>
<p>Blunt the knives and bend the forks!</p>
<p>That's what Bilbo Baggins hates-</p>
<p>Smash the bottles and burn the corks!</p>
<p>Cut the cloth and tread on the fat!</p>
<p>Pour the milk on the pantry floor!</p>
<p>Leave the bones on the bedroom mat!</p>
<p>Splash the wine on every door!</p>
<p>Dump the crocks in a boiling bawl;</p>
<p>Pound them up with a thumping pole;</p>
<p>And when you've finished, if any are whole,</p>
<p>Send them down the hall to roll !</p>
<p>That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!</p>
<p>So, carefully! carefully with the plates!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>And of course they did none of these dreadful things, and everything was
cleaned and put away safe as quick as lightning, while the hobbit was turning
round and round in the middle of the kitchen trying to see what they were doing.
Then they went back, and found Thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a
pipe. He was blowing the most enormous smoke-rings, and wherever he told one to
go, it went-up the chimney, or behind the clock on the mantelpiece, or under the
table, or round and round the ceiling; but wherever it went it was not quick
enough to escape Gandalf. Pop! he sent a smaller smoke-ring from his short
clay-pipe straight through each one of Thorin's. The Gandalf's smoke-ring would
go green and come back to hover over the wizard's head. He had quite a cloud of
them about him already, and in the dim light it made him look strange and
sorcerous. Bilbo stood still and watched-he loved smoke-rings-and then be
blushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the smoke-rings he
had sent up the wind over The Hill.</p>
<p>"Now for some music!" said Thorin. "Bring out the
instruments!"</p>
<p>Kili and Fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles; Dori,
Nori, and Ori brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats; Bombur
produced a drum from the hall; Bifur and Bofur went out too, and came back with
clarinets that they had left among the walking-sticks Dwalin and Balin said:
"Excuse me, I left mine in the porch!" "Just bring mine in with
you," said Thorin. They came back with viols as big as themselves, and with
Thorin’s harp wrapped in a green cloth. It was a beautiful gold-en harp, and
when Thorin struck it the music began all at once, so sudden and sweet that
Bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept away into dark lands under strange
moons, far over The Water and very far from his hobbit-hole under The Hill.</p>
<p>The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of
The Hill; the firelight flickered-it was April-and still they played on, while
the shadow of Gandalf's beard wagged against the wall.</p>
<p>The dark filled all the room, and the fire died down, and the shadows were
lost, and still they played on. And suddenly first one and then another began to
sing as they played, deep-throated singing of the dwarves in the deep places of
their ancient homes; and this is like a fragment of their song, if it can be
like their song without their music.</p>

</i>
<p>As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and
by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the
desire of the hearts of dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and
he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the
waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick.
He looked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees.
He thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly in the
wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up--probably somebody lighting a
wood-fire-and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and
kindling it all to flames. He shuddered; and very quickly he was plain Mr.
Baggins of Bag-End, Under-Hill, again.</p>
<p>He got up trembling. He had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp, and more
than half a mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the beer barrels in the
cellar, and not come out again until all the dwarves had gone away. Suddenly he
found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at
him with eyes shining in the dark.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" said Thorin, in a tone that seemed to show
that he guessed both halves of the hobbit's mind.</p>
<p>"What about a little light?" said Bilbo apologetically.</p>
<p>"We like the dark," said the dwarves. "Dark for dark business!
There are many hours before dawn."</p>
<p>"Of course!" said Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. He missed the
stool and sat in the fender, knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash.</p>
<p>"Hush!" said Gandalf. "Let Thorin speak!" And this is bow
Thorin began.</p>
<p>"Gandalf, dwarves and Mr. Baggins! We are not together in the house of
our friend and fellow conspirator, this most excellent and audacious hobbit -
may the hair on his toes never fall out! all praise to his wine and ale! -"
He paused for breath and for a polite remark from the hobbit, but the
compliments were quite lost on poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in
protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no
noise came out, he was so flummoxed. So Thorin went on:</p>
<p>"We are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy and devices.
We shall soon before the break of day start on our long journey, a journey from
which some of us, or perhaps all of us (except our friend and counsellor, the
ingenious wizard Gandalf) may never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object
is, I take it, well known to us all. To the estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps
to one or two of the younger dwarves (I think I should be right in naming Kili
and Fili, for instance), the exact situation at the moment may require a little
brief explanation-"</p>
<p>This was Thorin's style. He was an important dwarf. If he had been allowed,
he would probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath, without
telling any one there 'anything that was not known already. But he was rudely
interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn't bear it any longer. At may never return he
began to feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon it burst out like the
whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang Bp knocking
over the table. Gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his magic staff, and
in its firework glare the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the
hearth-rug, shaking like a jelly that was melting. Then he fell flat on the
floor, and kept on calling out "struck by lightning, struck by
lightning!" over and over again; and that was all they could get out of him
for a long time. So they took him and laid him out of the way on the
drawing-room sofa with a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark
business.</p>
<p>"Excitable little fellow," said Gandalf, as they sat down again.
"Gets funny queer fits, but he is one of the best, one of the best-as
fierce as a dragon in a pinch."</p>
<p>If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realize that this was
only poetical exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to Old Took's
great-granduncle Bullroarer, who was so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a
horse. He charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of the
Green Fields, and knocked their king Golfimbul's head clean off with a wooden
club. It sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole, and
in this way the battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer's gentler descendant was reviving in
the drawing-room. After a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of
the parlour. This is what he heard, Gloin speaking: "Humph!" (or some
snort more or less like that). "Will he do, do you think? It is all very
well for Gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like
that in a moment of excitement would be enough to wake the dragon and all his
relatives, and kill the lot of us. I think it sounded more like fright than
excitement! In fact, if it bad not been for the sign on the door, I should have
been sure we had come to the wrong house. As soon as I clapped eyes on the
little fellow bobbing and puffing on the mat, I had my doubts. He looks more
like a grocer-than a burglar!"</p>
<p>Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The Took side had won. He
suddenly felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce. As for
little fellow bobbing on the mat it almost made him really fierce. Many a time
afterwards the Baggins part regretted what he did now, and he said to himself:
"Bilbo, you were a fool; you walked right in and put your foot in it."</p>
<p>"Pardon me," he said, "if I have overheard words that you were
saying. I don't pretend to understand what you are talking about, or your
reference to burglars, but I think I am right in believing" (this is what
he called being on his dignity) "that you think I am no good. I will show
you. I have no signs on my door-it was painted a week ago-, and I am quite sure
you have come to the wrong house. As soon as I saw your funny faces on the
door-step, I had my doubts. But treat it as the right one. Tell me what you want
done, and I will try it, if I have to walk from here to the East of East and
fight the wild Were-worms in the Last Desert. I had a
great-great-great-granduncle once, Bullroarer Took, and -"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, but that was long ago," said Gloin. "I was talking
about you. And I assure you there is a mark on this door-the usual one in the
trade, or used to be. Burglar wants a good job, plenty of Excitement and
reasonable Reward, that's how it is usually read. You can say Expert
Treasure-hunter instead of Burglar if you like. Some of them do. It's all the
same to us. Gandalf told us that there was a man of the sort in these parts
looking for a Job at once, and that he had arranged for a meeting here this
Wednesday tea-time."</p>
<p>"Of course there is a mark," said Gandalf. "I put it there
myself. For very good reasons. You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your
expedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins. Just let any one say I chose the wrong man
or the wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you
like, or go back to digging coal."</p>
<p>He scowled so angrily at Gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair; and
when Bilbo tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he turned and frowned at
him and stuck oat his bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a
snap. "That's right," said Gandalf. "Let's have no more argument.
I have chosen Mr. Baggins and that ought to be enough for all of you. If I say
he is a Burglar, a Burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot
more in him than you guess, and a deal more than he has any idea of himself. You
may (possibly) all live to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my boy, fetch the lamp, and
let's have little light on this!"</p>
<p>On the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shad he spread a piece of
parchment rather like a map.</p>
<p>"This was made by Thror, your grandfather, Thorin, he said in answer to
the dwarves' excited questions. "It is a plan of the Mountain."</p>
<p>"I don't see that this will help us much," said Thorin
disappointedly after a glance. "I remember the Mountain well enough and the
lands about it. And I know where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the
great dragons bred."</p>
<p>"There is a dragon marked in red on the Mountain, said Balin, "but
it will be easy enough to find him without that, if ever we arrive there."</p>
<p>"There is one point that you haven't noticed," said the wizard,
"and that is the secret entrance. You see that rune on the West side, and
the hand pointing to it from the other runes?** That marks a hidden passage
to the Lower Halls.</p>
<p>"It may have been secret once," said Thorin, "but how do we
know that it is secret any longer? Old Smaug had lived there long enough now to
find out anything there is to know about those caves."</p>
<p>"He may-but he can't have used it for years and years. "Why?"</p>
<p>"Because it is too small. 'Five feet high the door and three may walk
abreast' say the runes, but Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not
even when he was a young dragon, certainly not after devouring so many of the
dwarves and men of Dale."</p>
<p>"It seems a great big hole to me," squeaked Bilbo (who had no
experience of dragons and only of hobbit-holes) He was getting excited and
interested again, so that he forgot to keep his mouth shut. He loved maps, and
in his hall there hung a large one of the Country Round with all his favourite
walks marked on it in red ink. "How could such a large door be kept secret
from everybody outside, apart from the dragon?" he asked. He was only a
little hobbit you must remember.</p>
<p>"In lots of ways," said Gandalf. "But in what way this one has
been hidden we don't know without going to see. From what it says on the map I
should guess there is a closed door which has been made to look exactly like the
side of the Mountain. That is the usual dwarves' method- I think that is right,
isn't it?" "Quite right," said Thorin.</p>
<p>"Also," went on Gandalf, "I forgot to mention that with the
map went a key, a small and curious key. Here it is!" he said, and handed
to Thorin a key with a long barrel and intricate wards, made of silver.
"Keep it safe!"</p>
<p>"Indeed I will," said Thorin, and he fastened it upon a fine chain
that hung about his neck and under his jacket. "Now things begin to look
more hopeful. This news alters them much for-the better. So far we have had no
clear idea what to do. We thought of going East, as quiet and careful as we
could, as far as the Long Lake. After that the trouble would begin."</p>
<p>"A long time before that, if I know anything about the loads East,"
interrupted Gandalf.</p>
<p>"We might go from there up along the River Running," went on Thorin
taking no notice, "and so to the ruins of Dale-the old town in the valley
there, under the shadow of the Mountain. But we none of us liked the idea of the
Front Gate. The river runs right out of it through the great cliff at the South
of the Mountain, and out of it comes the dragon too-far too often, unless he has
changed."</p>
<p>"That would be no good," said the wizard, "not without a
mighty Warrior, even a Hero. I tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting
one another in distant lands, and in this neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or
simply lot to be found. Swords in these parts are mostly blunt, and axes are
used for trees, and shields as cradles or dish-covers; and dragons are
comfortably far-off (and therefore legendary). That is why I settled on
burglary-especially when I remembered the existence of a Side-door. And here is
our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. So now
let's get on and make some plans."</p>
<p>"Very well then," said Thorin, "supposing the burglar-expert
gives us some ideas or suggestions." He turned with mock-politeness to
Bilbo.</p>
<p>"First I should like to know a bit more about things," said he,
feeling all confused and a bit shaky inside, but so far still lookishly
determined to go on with things. "I mean about the gold and the dragon, and
all that, and how it got there, and who it belongs to, and so on and
further."</p>
<p>"Bless me!" said Thorin, "haven't you got a map? and didn't
you hear our song? and haven't we been talking about all this for hours?"</p>
<p>"All the same, I should like it all plain and clear," said he
obstinately, putting on his business manner (usually reserved for people who
tried to borrow money off him), and doing his best to appear wise and prudent
and professional and live up to Gandalf's recommendation. "Also I should
like to know about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time required and
remuneration, and so forth"-by which he meant: "What am I going to get
out of it? and am I going to come back alive?"</p>
<p>"O very well," said Thorin. "Long ago in my grandfather
Thror's time our family was driven out of the far North, and came back with all
their wealth and their tools to this Mountain on the map. It had been discovered
by my far ancestor, Thrain the Old, but now they mined and they tunnelled and
they made huger halls and greater workshops -and in addition I believe they
found a good deal of gold and a great many jewels too. Anyway they grew
immensely rich and famous, and my grandfather was King under the Mountain again
and treated with great reverence by the mortal men, who lived to the South, and
were gradually spreading up the Running River as far as the valley overshadowed
by the Mountain. They built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings
used to send for our smiths, and reward even the least skilful most richly.
Fathers would beg us to take their sons as apprentices, and pay us handsomely,
especially in food-supplies, which we never bothered to grow or find for
ourselves. Altogether those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had
money to spend and to lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just for the.
fun of it, not to speak of the most marvellous and magical toys, the like of
which is not to be found in the world now-a-days. So my grandfather's halls
became full of armour and jewels and carvings and cups, and the toy-market of
Dale was the wonder of the North.</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly that was what brought the dragon. Dragons steal gold and
jewels, you know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find them;
and they guard their plunder as long as they live (which is practically forever,
unless they are killed), and never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed they hardly
know a good bit of work from a bad, though they usually have a good notion of
the current market value; and they can't make a thing for themselves, not even
mend a little loose scale of their armour. There were lots of dragons in the
North in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up there, with the
dwarves flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and
destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse. There was a most
specially greedy, strong and wicked worm called Smaug. One day he flew up into
the air and came south. The first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane
coming from the North, and the pine-trees on the Mountain creaking and cracking
in the wind. Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside (I was one luckily
-a fine adventurous lad in those days, always wandering about, and it saved my
life that day)-well, from a good way off we saw the dragon settle on our
mountain in a spout of flame. Then he came down the slopes and when he reached
the woods they all went up in fire. By that time all the bells were ringing in
Dale and the warriors were arming. The dwarves rushed out of their great gate;
but there was the dragon waiting for them. None escaped that way. The river
rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale, and in the fog the dragon came on
them and destroyed most of the warriors-the usual unhappy story, it was only too
common in those days. Then he went back and crept in through the Front Gate and
routed out all the halls, and lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and
passages. After that there were no dwarves left alive inside, and he took all
their wealth for himself. Probably, for that is the dragons' way, he has piled
it all up in a great heap far inside, and sleeps on it for a bed. Later he used
to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to Dale, and carry away people,
especially maidens, to eat, until Dale was ruined, and all the people dead or
gone. What goes on there now I don't know for certain, but I don't suppose
anyone lives nearer to the Mountain than the far edge of the Long Lake
now-a-days.</p>
<p>"The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed
Smaug; and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather
with singed beards. They looked very grim but they said very little. When I
asked how they had got away, they told me to hold my tongue, and said that one
day in the proper time I should know. After that we went away, and we have had
to earn our livings as best we could up and down the lands, often enough sinking
as low as blacksmith-work or even coalmining. But we have never forgotten our
stolen treasure. And even now, when I will allow we have a good bit laid by and
are not so badly off"-here Thorin stroked the gold chain round his
neck-"we still mean to get it back, and to bring our curses home to
Smaug-if we can.</p>
<p>"I have often wondered about my father's and my grandfather's escape. I
see now they must have had a private Side-door which only they knew about. But
apparently they made a map, and I should like to know how Gandalf got hold of
it, and why it did not come down to me, the rightful heir."</p>
<p>"I did not 'get hold of it,' I was given it," said the wizard.</p>
<p>"Your grandfather Thror was killed, you remember, in the mines of Moria
by Azog the Goblin -"</p>
<p>"Curse his name, yes," said Thorin.</p>
<p>"And Thrain your father went away on the twenty-first of April, a
hundred years ago last Thursday, and has never been seen by you since-"</p>
<p>"True, true," said Thorin.</p>
<p>"Well, your father gave me this to give to you; and if I have chosen my
own time and way of handing it over, you can hardly blame me, considering the
trouble I had to find you. Your father could not remember his own name when he
gave me the paper, and he never told me yours; so on the whole I think I ought
to be praised and thanked. Here it is," said he handing the map to Thorin.</p>
<p>"I don't understand," said Thorin, and Bilbo felt he would have
liked to say the same. The explanation did not seem to explain.</p>
<p>"Your grandfather," said the wizard slowly and grimly, "gave
the map to his son for safety before he went to the mines of Moria. Your father
went away to try his luck with the map after your grandfather was killed; and
lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had, but he never got near the
Mountain. How he got there I don't know, but I found him a prisoner in the
dungeons of the Necromancer."</p>
<p>"Whatever were you doing there?" asked Thorin with a shudder, and
all the dwarves shivered.</p>
<p>"Never you mind. I was finding things out, as usual; and a nasty
dangerous business it was. Even I, Gandalf, only just escaped. I tried to save
your father, but it was too late. He was witless and wandering, and had
forgotten almost everything except the map and the key." "We have long
ago paid the goblins of Moria," said Thorin; "we must give a thought
to the Necromancer." "Don't be absurd! He is an enemy quite beyond the
powers of all the dwarves put together, if they could all be collected again
from the four corners of the world. The one thing your father wished was for his
son to read the map and use the key. The dragon and the Mountain are more than
big enough tasks for you!"</p>
<p>"Hear, hear!" said Bilbo, and accidentally said it aloud,
"Hear what?" they all said turning suddenly towards him, and he was so
flustered that he answered "Hear what I have got to say!" "What's
that?" they asked.</p>
<p>"Well, I should say that you ought to go East and have a look round.
After all there is the Side-door, and dragons must sleep sometimes, I suppose.
If you sit on the doorstep long enough, I daresay you will think of something.
And well, don't you know, I think we have talked long enough for one night, if
you see what I mean. What about bed, and an early start, and all that? I will
give you a good breakfast before you go."</p>
<p>"Before we go, I suppose you mean," said Thorin. "Aren't you
the burglar? And isn't sitting on the door-step your job, not to speak of
getting inside the door? But I agree about bed and breakfast. I like eggs with
my ham, when starting on a journey: fried not poached, and mind you don't break
'em."</p>
<p>After all the others had ordered their breakfasts without so much as a please
(which annoyed Bilbo very much), they all got up. The hobbit had to find room
for them all, and filled all his spare-rooms and made beds on chairs and sofas,
before he got them all stowed and went to his own little bed very tired and not
altogether happy. One thing he did make his mind up about was not to bother to
get up very early and cook everybody else's wretched breakfast. The Tookishness
was wearing off, and he was not now quite so sure that he was going on any
journey in the morning. As he lay in bed he could hear Thorin still humming to
himself in the best bedroom next to him:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Far over the misty mountains cold</p>
<p>To dungeons deep and caverns old</p>
<p>We must away, ere break of day,</p>
<p>To find our long-forgotten gold.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>Bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears, and it gave him very uncomfortable
dreams. It was long after the break of day, when he woke up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="02"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<h2>Roast Mutton</h2>
<p>Up jumped Bilbo, and putting on his dressing-gown went into the dining-room.
There he saw nobody, but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There
was a fearful mess in the room, and piles of unwashed crocks in the kitchen.
Nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used. The washing-up
was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night
before had not been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped. Indeed he
was really relieved after all to think that they had all gone without him, and
without bothering to wake him up ("but with never a thank-you" he
thought); and yet in a way he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed.
The feeling surprised him.</p>
<p>"Don't be a fool, Bilbo Baggins!" he said to himself,
"thinking of dragons and all that outlandish nonsense at your age!" So
be put on an apron, lit fires, boiled water, and washed up. Then he had a nice
little breakfast in the kitchen before turning out the dining-room. By that time
the sun was shining; and the front door was open, letting in a warm spring
breeze. Bilbo began to whistle loudly and to forget about the night before. In
fact he was just sitting down to a nice little second breakfast in the
dining-room by the open window, when in walked Gandalf. "My dear
fellow," said he, "whenever are you going to come? What about an early
start?-and here you are having breakfast, or whatever you call it, at half past
ten! They left you the message, because they could not wait."</p>
<p>"What message?" said poor Mr. Baggins all in a fluster.</p>
<p>"Great Elephants!" said Gandalf, "you are not at all yourself
this morning-you have never dusted the mantel- piece!"</p>
<p>"What's that got to do with it? I have had enough to do with washing up
for fourteen!"</p>
<p>"If you had dusted the mantelpiece you would have found this just under
the clock," said Gandalf, handing Bilbo a note (written, of course, on his
own note-paper).</p>
<p>This is what he read:</p>
<p>"Thorin and Company to Burglar Bilbo greeting!</p>
<p>For your hospitality our sincerest thanks, and for your offer of professional
assistance our grateful acceptance. Terms: cash on delivery, up to and not
exceeding one fourteenth of total profits (if any); all travelling expenses
guaranteed in any event; funeral expenses to be defrayed by us or our
representatives, if occasion arises and the matter is not otherwise arranged
for.</p>
<p>"Thinking it unnecessary to disturb your esteemed repose, we have
proceeded in advance to make requisite preparations, and shall await your
respected person at the Green Dragon Inn, Bywater, at II a.m. sharp. Trusting
that you will be punctual.</p>
<p>"We have the honour to remain</p>
<p>"Yours deeply</p>
<p>"Thorin &amp; Co."</p>
<p>"That leaves you just ten minutes. You will have to run," said
Gandalf.</p>
<p>"But-" said Bilbo.</p>
<p>"No time for it," said the wizard.</p>
<p>"But-"said Bilbo again.</p>
<p>"No time for that either! Off you go!"</p>
<p>To the end of his days Bilbo could never remember how he found himself
outside, without a hat, walking-stick or say money, or anything that he usually
took when he went out; leaving his second breakfast half-finished and quite
unwashed-up, pushing his keys into Gandalf's hands, and running as fast as his
furry feet could carry him down the lane, past the great Mill, across The Water,
and then on for a whole mile or more. Very puffed he was, when he got to Bywater
just on the stroke of eleven, and found he had come without a
pocket-handkerchief!</p>
<p>"Bravo!" said Balin who was standing at the inn door looking out
for him.</p>
<p>Just then all the others came round the corner of the road from the village.
They were on ponies, and each pony was slung about with all kinds of baggages,
packages, parcels, and paraphernalia. There was a very small pony, apparently
for Bilbo.</p>
<p>"Up you two get, and off we go!" said Thorin.</p>
<p>"I'm awfully sorry," said Bilbo, "but I have come without my
hat, and I have left my pocket-handkerchief behind, and I haven't got any money.
I didn't get your note until after 10.45 to be precise."</p>
<p>"Don't be precise," said Dwalin, "and don't worry! You will
have to manage without pocket-handkerchiefs, and a good many other things,
before you get to the journey's end. As for a hat, I have got a spare hood and
cloak in my luggage."</p>
<p>That's how they all came to start, jogging off from the inn one fine morning
just before May, on laden ponies; and Bilbo was wearing a dark-green hood (a
little weather-stained) and a dark-green cloak borrowed from Dwalin. They were
too large for him, and he looked rather comic. What his father Bungo would have
thought of him, I daren't think. His only comfort was he couldn't be mistaken
for a dwarf, as he had no beard.</p>
<p>They had not been riding very long when up came Gandalf very splendid on a
white horse. He had brought a lot of pocket-handkerchiefs, and Bilbo's pipe and
tobacco. So after that the party went along very merrily, and they told stories
or sang songs as they rode forward all day, except of course when they stopped
for meals. These didn't come quite as often as Bilbo would have liked them, but
still he began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all. At first they
had passed through hobbit-lands, a wild respectable country inhabited by decent
folk, with good roads, an inn or two, and now and then a dwarf or a farmer
ambling by on business. Then they came to lands where people spoke strangely,
and sang songs Bilbo had never heard before. Now they had gone on far into the
Lone-lands, where there were no people left, no inns, and the roads grew
steadily worse. Not far ahead were dreary hills, rising higher and higher, dark
with trees. On some of them were old castles with an evil look, as if they had
been built by wicked people. Everything seemed gloomy, for the weather that day
had taken a nasty turn. Mostly it had been as good as May can be, even in merry
tales, but now it was cold and wet. In the Lone-lands they had to camp when they
could, but at least it had been dry. "To think it will soon be June,"
grumbled Bilbo as he splashed along behind the others in a very muddy track. It
was after tea-time; it was pouring with rain, and had been all day; his hood was
dripping into his eyes, his cloak was full of water; the pony was tired and
stumbled on stones; the others were too grumpy to talk. "And I'm sure the
rain has got into the dry clothes and into the food-bags," thought Bilbo.
"Bother burgling and everything to do with it! I wish I was at home in my
nice hole by the fire, with the kettle just beginning to sing!" It was not
the last time that he wished that!</p>
<p>Still the dwarves jogged on, never turning round or taking any notice of the
hobbit. Somewhere behind the grey clouds the sun must have gone down, for it
began to get dark. Wind got up, and the willows along the river-bank bent and
sighed. I don't know what river it was, a rushing red one, swollen with the
rains of the last few days, that came down from the hills and mountains in front
of them. Soon it was nearly dark. The winds broke up the grey clouds, and a
waning moon appeared above the hills between the flying rags. Then they stopped,
and Thorin muttered something about supper, "and where shall we get a dry
patch to sleep on?" Not until then did they notice that Gandalf was
missing. So far he had come all the way with them, never saying if he was in the
adventure or merely keeping them company for a while. He had eaten most, talked
most, and laughed most. But now he simply was not there at all!</p>
<p>"Just when a wizard would have been most useful, too," groaned Dori
and Nori (who shared the hobbit's views about regular meals, plenty and often).
They decided in the end that they would have to camp where they were. So far
they had not camped before on this journey, and though they knew that they soon
would have to camp regularly, when they were among the Misty Mountains and far
from the lands of respectable people, it seemed a bad wet evening to begin, on.
They moved to a clump of trees, and though it was drier under them, the wind
shook the rain off the leaves, and the drip, drip, was most annoying. Also the
mischief seemed to have got into the fire. Dwarves can make a fire almost
anywhere out of almost anything, wind or no wind; but they could not do it that
night, not even Oin and Gloin, who were specially good at it.</p>
<p>Then one of the ponies took fright at nothing and bolted. He got into the
river before they could catch him; and before they could get him out again, Fili
and Kili were nearly drowned, and all the baggage that he carried was washed
away off him. Of course it was mostly food, and there was mighty little left for
supper, and less for breakfast. There they all sat glum and wet and muttering,
while Oin and Gloin went on trying to light the fire, and quarrelling about it.
Bilbo was sadly reflecting that adventures are not all pony-rides in
May-sunshine, when Balin, who was always their look-out man, said: "There's
a light over there!" There was a hill some way off with trees on it, pretty
thick in parts. Out of the dark mass of the trees they could now see a light
shining, a reddish comfortable-looking light, as it might be a fire or torches
twinkling. When they had looked at it for some while, they fell to arguing. Some
said "no" and some said "yes." Some said they could but go
and see, and anything was better than little supper, less breakfast, and wet
clothes all the night. Others said: "These parts are none too well known,
and are too near the mountains. Travellers seldom come this way now. The old
maps are no use: things have changed for the worse and the road is unguarded.
They have seldom even heard of the king round here, and the less inquisitive you
are as you go along, the less trouble you are likely to find." Some said:
"After all there are fourteen of us." Others said: "Where has
Gandalf got to?" This remark was repeated by everybody. Then the rain began
to pour down worse than ever, and Oin and Gloin began to fight. That settled it.
"After all we have got a burglar with us," they said; and so they made
off, leading their ponies (with all due and proper caution) in the direction of
the light. They came to the hill and were soon in the wood. Up the hill they
went; but there was no proper path to be seen, such as might lead to a house or
a farm; and do what they could they made a deal of rustling and crackling and
creaking (and a good deal of grumbling and drafting), as they went through the
trees in the pitch dark.</p>
<p>Suddenly the red light shone out very bright through the tree-trunks not far
ahead. "Now it is the burglar's turn," they said, meaning Bilbo.
"You must go on and find out all about that light, and what it is for, and
if all is perfectly safe and canny," said Thorin to the hobbit. "Now
scuttle off, and come back quick, if all is well. If not, come back if you can!
It you can't, hoot twice like a barn-owl and once like a screech-owl, and we
will do what we can."</p>
<p>Off Bilbo had to go, before he could explain that he could not hoot even once
like any kind of owl any more than fly like a bat. But at any rate hobbits can
move quietly in woods, absolutely quietly. They take a pride in it, and Bilbo
had sniffed more than once at what he called "all this dwarvish
racket," as they went along, though I don't sup-pose you or I would notice
anything at all on a windy night, not if the whole cavalcade had passed two feet
off. As for Bilbo walking primly towards the red light, I don't suppose even a
weasel would have stirred a whisker at it. So, naturally, he got right up to the
fire-for fire it was without disturbing anyone. And this is what he saw. Three
very large persons sitting round a very large fire of beech-logs. They were
toasting mutton on long spits of wood, and licking the gravy off their fingers.
There was a fine toothsome smell. Also there was a barrel of good drink at hand,
and they were drinking out of jugs. But they were trolls. Obviously trolls. Even
Bilbo, in spite of his sheltered life, could see that: from the great heavy
faces of them, and their size, and the shape of their legs, not to mention their
language, which was not drawing-room fashion at all, at all.</p>
<p>"Mutton yesterday, mutton today, and blimey, if it don't look like
mutton again tomorrer," said one of the trolls.</p>
<p>"Never a blinking bit of manflesh have we had for long enough,"
said a second. "What the 'ell William was a-thinkin' of to bring us into
these parts at all, beats me - and the drink runnin' short, what's more,"
he said jogging the elbow of William, who was taking a pull at his jug.</p>
<p>William choked. "Shut yer mouth!" he said as soon as he could.
"Yer can't expect folk to stop here for ever just to be et by you and Bert.
You've et a village and a half between yer, since we come down from the
mountains. How much more d'yer want? And time's been up our way, when yer'd have
said 'thank yer Bill' for a nice bit o' fat valley mutton like what this
is." He took a big bite off a sheep's leg he was toasting, and wiped his
lips on his sleeve.</p>
<p>Yes, I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head
each. After hearing all this Bilbo ought to have done something at once. Either
he should have gone back quietly and warned his friends that there were three
fair-sized trolls at hand in a nasty mood, quite likely to try toasted dwarf, or
even pony, for a change; or else he should have done a bit of good quick
burgling. A really first-class and legendary burglar would at this point have
picked the trolls' pockets-it is nearly always worthwhile if you can manage it-,
pinched the very mutton off the spite, purloined the beer, and walked off
without their noticing him. Others more practical but with less professional
pride would perhaps have stuck a dagger into each of them before they observed
it. Then the night could have been spent cheerily.</p>
<p>Bilbo knew it. He had read of a good many things he had never seen or done.
He was very much alarmed, as well as disgusted; he wished himself a hundred
miles away, and yet-and yet somehow he could not go straight back to Thorin and
Company empty-handed. So he stood and hesitated in the shadows. Of the various
burglarious proceedings he had heard of picking the trolls' pockets seemed the
least difficult, so at last he crept behind a tree just behind William.</p>
<p>Bert and Tom went off to the barrel. William was having another drink. Then
Bilbo plucked up courage and put his little hand in William's enormous pocket.
There was a purse in it, as big as a bag to Bilbo. "Ha!" thought he
warming to his new work as he lifted it carefully out, "this is a
beginning!"</p>
<p>It was! Trolls' purses are the mischief, and this was no exception. "
'Ere, 'oo are you?" it squeaked, as it left the pocket; and William turned
round at once and grabbed Bilbo by the neck, before he could duck behind the
tree.</p>
<p>"Blimey, Bert, look what I've copped!" said William.</p>
<p>"What is it?" said the others coming up.</p>
<p>"Lumme, if I knows! What are yer?"</p>
<p>"Bilbo Baggins, a bur­- a hobbit," said poor Bilbo, shaking all
over, and wondering how to make owl-noises before they throttled him.</p>
<p>"A burrahobbit?" said they a bit startled. Trolls are slow in the
uptake, and mighty suspicious about anything new to them.</p>
<p>"What's a burrahobbit got to do with my pocket, anyways?" said
William.</p>
<p>"And can yer cook 'em?" said Tom.</p>
<p>"Yer can try," said Bert, picking up a skewer.</p>
<p>"He wouldn't make above a mouthful," said William, who had already
had a fine supper, "not when he was skinned and boned."</p>
<p>"P'raps there are more like him round about, and we might make a
pie," said Bert. "Here you, are there any more of your sort a-sneakin'
in these here woods, yer nassty little rabbit," said he looking at the
hobbit's furry feet; and he picked him up by the toes and shook him.</p>
<p>"Yes, lots," said Bilbo, before he remembered not to give his
friends away. "No, none at all, not one," he said immediately
afterwards.</p>
<p>"What d'yer mean?" said Bert, holding him right away up, by the
hair this time.</p>
<p>"What I say," said Bilbo gasping. "And please don't cook me,
kind sirs! I am a good cook myself, and cook bet-ter than I cook, if you see
what I mean. I'll cook beautifully for you, a perfectly beautiful breakfast for
you, if only you won't have me for supper."</p>
<p>"Poor little blighter," said William. He had already had as much
supper as he could hold; also he had had lots of beer. "Poor little
blighter! Let him go!"</p>
<p>"Not till he says what he means by lots and none at all," said
Bert. "I don't want to have me throat cut in me sleep. Hold his toes in the
fire, till he talks!"</p>
<p>"I won't have it," said William. "I caught him anyway."</p>
<p>"You're a fat fool, William," said Bert, "as I've said afore
this evening."</p>
<p>"And you're a lout!"</p>
<p>"And I won't take that from you. Bill Huggins," says Bert, and puts
his fist in William's eye.</p>
<p>Then there was a gorgeous row. Bilbo had just enough wits left, when Bert
dropped him on the ground, to scramble out of the way of their feet, before they
were fighting like dogs, and calling one another all sorts of perfectly true and
applicable names in very loud voices. Soon they were locked in one another's
arms, and rolling nearly into the fire kicking and thumping, while Tom whacked
at then both with a branch to bring them to their senses-and that of course only
made them madder than ever. That would have been the time for Bilbo to have
left. But his poor little feet had been very squashed in Bert's big paw, and he
had no breath in his body, and his head was going round; so there he lay for a
while panting, just outside the circle of firelight.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of the fight up came Balin. The dwarves had heard noises
from a distance, and after wait-ing for some time for Bilbo to come back, or to
hoot like an owl, they started off one by one to creep towards the light as
quietly as they could. No sooner did Tom see Balin come into the light than he
gave an awful howl. Trolls simply detest the very sight of dwarves (uncooked).
Bert and Bill stopped fighting immediately, and "a sack, Tom, quick!"
they said, before Balin, who was wondering where in all this commotion Bilbo
was, knew what was happening, a sack was over his head, and he was down.</p>
<p>"There's more to come yet," said Tom, "or I'm mighty mistook.
Lots and none at all, it is," said he. "No burra- hobbits, but lots of
these here dwarves. That's about the shape of it!"</p>
<p>"I reckon you're right," said Bert, "and we'd best get out of
the light."</p>
<p>And so they did. With sacks in their hands, that they used for carrying off
mutton and other plunder, they waited in the shadows. As each dwarf came up and
looked at the fire, and the spilled jugs, and the gnawed mutton, in surprise,
pop! went a nasty smelly sack over his head, and he was down. Soon Dwalin lay by
Balin, and Fili and Kili together, and Dori and Nori and Ori all in a heap, and
Oin and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled uncomfortably near the fire.</p>
<p>"That'll teach 'em," said Tom; for Bifur and Bombur had given a lot
of trouble, and fought like mad, as dwarves will when cornered.</p>
<p>Thorin came last-and he was not caught unawares. He came expecting mischief,
and didn't need to see his friends' legs sticking out of sacks to tell him that
things were not all well. He stood outside in the shadows some way off, and
said: "What's all this trouble? Who has been knocking my people
about?"</p>
<p>"It's trolls!" said Bilbo from behind a tree. They had forgotten
all about him. "They're hiding in the bushes with sacks," said he.</p>
<p>"O! are they?" said Thorin, and he jumped forward to the fire,
before they could leap on him. He caught up a big branch all on fire at one end;
and Bert got that end in his eye before he could step aside. That put him out of
the battle for a bit. Bilbo did his best. He caught hold of Tom's leg-as well as
he could, it was thick as a young tree-trunk -but he was sent spinning up into
the top of some bushes, when Tom kicked the sparks up in Thorin's face.</p>
<p>Tom got the branch in his teeth for that, and lost one of the front ones. It
made him howl, I can tell you. But just at that moment William came up behind
and popped a sack right over Thorin's head and down to his toes. And so the
fight ended. A nice pickle they were all in now: all neatly tied up in sacks,
with three angry trolls (and two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by
them, arguing whether they should roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil
them, or just sit on them one by one and squash them into jelly: and Bilbo up in
a bush, with his clothes and his skin torn, not daring to move for fear they
should hear him.</p>
<p>It was just then that Gandalf came back. But no one saw him. The trolls had
just decided to roast the dwarves now and eat them later-that was Bert's idea,
and after a lot of argument they had all agreed to it.</p>
<p>"No good roasting 'em now, it’d take all night," said a voice.
Bert thought it was William's.</p>
<p>"Don't start the argument all over-again. Bill," he said, "or
it will take all night."</p>
<p>"Who's a-arguing?" said William, who thought it was. Bert that had
spoken.</p>
<p>"You are," said Bert.</p>
<p>"You're a liar," said William; and so the argument beg all over
again. In the end they decided to mince them fine and boil them. So they got a
black pot, and they took out their knives.</p>
<p>"No good boiling 'em! We ain't got no water, and it's a long way to the
well and all," said a voice. Bert and William thought it was Tom's.</p>
<p>"Shut up!" said they, "or we'll never have done. And yer can
fetch the water yerself, if yer say any more."</p>
<p>"Shut up yerself!" said Tom, who thought it was William's voice.
"Who's arguing but you. I'd like to know."</p>
<p>"You're a booby," said William.</p>
<p>"Booby yerself!" said Tom.</p>
<p>And so the argument began all over again, and went on hotter than ever, until
at last they decided to sit on the sacks one by one and squash them, and boil
them next time.</p>
<p>"Who shall we sit on first?" said the voice.</p>
<p>"Better sit on the last fellow first," said Bert, whose eye had
been damaged by Thorin. He thought Tom was talking.</p>
<p>"Don't talk to yerself!" said Tom. "But if you wants to sit on
the last one, sit on him. Which is he?"</p>
<p>"The one with the yellow stockings," said Bert.</p>
<p>"Nonsense, the one with the grey stockings," said a voice like
William's.</p>
<p>"I made sure it was yellow," said Bert.</p>
<p>"Yellow it was," said William.</p>
<p>"Then what did yer say it was grey for?" said Bert.</p>
<p>"I never did. Tom said it."</p>
<p>"That I never did!" said Tom. "It was you."</p>
<p>"Two to one, so shut yer mouth!" said Bert.</p>
<p>"Who are you a-talkin' to?" said William.</p>
<p>"Now stop it!" said Tom and Bert together. "The night's
gettin' on, and dawn comes early. Let's get on with it!"</p>
<p>"Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!" said a voice that sounded
like William's. But it wasn't. For just at that moment the light came over the
hill, and there was a mighty twitter in the branches. William never spoke for he
stood turned to stone as he stooped; and Bert and Tom were stuck like rocks as
they looked at him. And there they stand to this day, all alone, unless the
birds perch on them; for trolls, as you probably know, must be underground
before dawn, or they go back to the stuff of the mountains they are made of, and
never move again. That is what had happened to Bert and Tom and William.</p>
<p>"Excellent!" said Gandalf, as he stepped from behind a tree, and
helped Bilbo to climb down out of a thorn-bush. Then Bilbo understood. It was
the wizard's voice that had kept the trolls bickering and quarrelling, until the
light came and made an end of them.</p>
<p>The next thing was to untie the sacks and let out the dwarves. They were
nearly suffocated, and very annoyed: they had not at all enjoyed lying there
listening to the trolls making plans for roasting them and squashing them and
mincing them. They had to hear Bilbo's account of what had happened to him twice
over, before they were satisfied.</p>
<p>"Silly time to go practising pinching and pocket-picking," said
Bombur, "when what we wanted was fire and food!"</p>
<p>"And that's just what you wouldn't have got of those fellows without a
struggle, in any case," said Gandalf.</p>
<p>"Anyhow you are wasting time now. Don't you realize that the trolls must
have a cave or a hole dug somewhere near to hide from the sun in? We must look
into it!"</p>
<p>They searched about, and soon found the marks of trolls' stony boots going
away through the trees. They followed the tracks up the hill, until hidden by
bushes they came on a big door of stone leading to a cave. But they could not
open it, not though they all pushed while Gandalf tried various incantations.</p>
<p>"Would this be any good?" asked Bilbo, when they were getting tired
and angry. "I found it on the ground where the trolls had their
fight." He held out a largish key, though no doubt William had thought it
very small and secret. It must have fallen out of his pocket, very luckily,
before he was turned to stone.</p>
<p>"Why on earth didn't you mention it before?" they cried.</p>
<p>Gandalf grabbed it and fitted it into the key-hole. Then the stone door swung
back with one big push, and they all went inside. There were bones on the floor
and a nasty smell was in the air; but there was a good deal of food jumbled
carelessly on shelves and on the ground, among an untidy litter of plunder, of
all sorts from brass buttons to pots full of gold coins standing in a corner.
There were lots of clothes, too, hanging on the walls-too small for trolls, I am
afraid they belonged to victims-and among them were several swords of various
makes, shapes, and sizes. Two caught their eyes particularly, because of their
beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts. Gandalf and Thorin each took one of
these; and Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. It would have made only a
tiny pocket-knife for a troll, but it was as good as a short sword for the
hobbit.</p>
<p>"These look like good blades," said the wizard, half drawing them
and looking at them curiously. "They were not made by any troll, nor by any
smith among men in these parts and days; but when we can read the runes on them,
we shall know more about them."</p>
<p>"Let's get out of this horrible smell!" said Fili So they carried
out the pots of coins, and such food as was un-touched and looked fit to eat,
also one barrel of ale which was still full. By that time they felt like
breakfast, and being very hungry they did not turn their noses up at what they
had got from the trolls' larder. Their own provisions were very scanty. Now they
had bread and cheese, and plenty of ale, and bacon to toast in the embers of the
fire. After that they slept, for their night had been disturbed; (and they did
nothing more till the afternoon. Then they I brought up their ponies, and
carried away the pots of gold, and buried them very secretly not far from the
track by the river, putting a great many spells over them, just in case they
ever had the-chance to come back and recover them. When that was done, they all
mounted once more, and jogged along again on the path towards the East.</p>
<p>"Where did you go to, if I may ask?" said Thorin to Gandalf as they
rode along.</p>
<p>"To look ahead," said he.</p>
<p>"And what brought you back in the nick of time?"</p>
<p>"Looking behind," said he.</p>
<p>"Exactly!" said Thorin; "but could you be more plain?"</p>
<p>"I went on to spy out our road. It will soon become dangerous and
difficult. Also I was anxious about replenishing our small stock of provisions.
I had not gone very far, however, when I met a couple of friends of mine from
Rivendell."</p>
<p>"Where's that?" asked Bilbo,</p>
<p>"Don't interrupt!" said Gandalf. "You will get there in a few
days now, if we're lucky, and find out all about it As I was saying I met two of
Elrond's people. They were hurrying along for fear of the trolls. It was they
who told me that three of them had come down from the mountains and settled in
the woods not far from the road; they had frightened everyone away from the
district, and they waylaid strangers.</p>
<p>"I immediately had a feeling that I was wanted back. Looking behind I
saw a fire in the distance and made for it. So now you know. Please be more
careful, next time, or we shall never get anywhere!"</p>
<p>"Thank you!" said Thorin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="03"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<h2>A Short Rest</h2>
<p>They did not sing or tell stories that day, even though the weather improved;
nor the next day, nor the day after. They had begun to feel that danger was not
far away on either side. They camped under the stars, and their horses had more
to eat than they had; for there was plenty of grass, but there was not much in
their bags, even with what they had got from the trolls. One morning they forded
a river at a wide shallow place full of the noise of stones and foam. The far
bank was steep and slippery. When they got to the top of it, leading their
ponies, they saw that the great mountains had marched down very near to them.
Already they I seemed only a day's easy journey from the feet of the nearest.
Dark and drear it looked, though there were patches of sunlight on its brown
sides, and behind its shoulders the tips of snow-peaks gleamed.</p>
<p>"Is that The Mountain?" asked Bilbo in a solemn voice, looking at
it with round eyes. He had never seen a thing that looked so big before.</p>
<p>"Of course not!" said Balin. "That is only the beginning of
the Misty Mountains, and we have to get through, or over, or under those
somehow, before we can come into Wilderland beyond. And it is a deal of a way
even from the other side of them to the Lonely Mountain in the East Where Smaug
lies on our treasure."</p>
<p>"O!" said Bilbo, and just at that moment he felt more fared than he
ever remembered feeling before. He was thinking once again of his comfortable
chair before the fire in his favourite sitting-room in his hobbit-hole, and of
the kettle singing. Not for the last time!</p>
<p>Now Gandalf led the way. "We must not miss the road, or we shall be done
for," he said. "We need food, for one thing, and rest in reasonable
safety-also it is very necessary to tackle the Misty Mountains by the proper
path, or else you will get lost in them, and have to come back and start at the
beginning again (if you ever get back at all)."</p>
<p>They asked him where he was making for, and he answered: "You are come
to the very edge of the Wild, as some of you may know. Hidden somewhere ahead of
us is the fair valley of Rivendell where Elrond lives in the Last Homely House.
I sent a message by my friends, and we are expected."</p>
<p>That sounded nice and comforting, but they had not got there yet, and it was
not so easy as it sounds to find the Last Homely House west of the Mountains.
There seemed to be no trees and no valleys and no hills to break the ground in
front of them, only one vast slope going slowly up and up to meet the feet of
the nearest mountain, a wide land the colour of heather and crumbling rock, with
patches and slashes of grass-green and moss-green showing where water might be.</p>
<p>Morning passed, afternoon came; but in all the silent waste there was no sign
of any dwelling. They were growing anxious, for they now saw that the house
might be hidden almost anywhere between them and the mountains. They came on
unexpected valleys, narrow with deep sides, that opened suddenly at their feet,
and they looked down surprised to see trees below them and running water at the
bottom. There were gullies that they could almost leap over; but very deep with
waterfalls in them. There were dark ravines that one could neither jump nor
climb into. There were bogs, some of them green pleasant places to look at with
flowers growing bright and tall; but a pony that walked there with a pack on its
back would never have come out again.</p>
<p>It was indeed a much wider land from the ford to the mountains than ever you
would have guessed. Bilbo was astonished. The only path was marked with white
stones some of which were small, and others were half covered with moss or
heather. Altogether it was a very slow business following the track, even guided
by Gandalf, who seemed to know his way about pretty well.</p>
<p>His head and beard wagged this way and that as he looked for the stones, and
they followed his head, but they seemed no nearer to the end of the search when
the day began to fail. Tea-time had long gone by, and it seemed supper-time
would soon do the same. There were moths fluttering about, and the light became
very dim, for the moon had not risen. Bilbo's pony began to stumble over roots
and stones. They came to the edge of a steep fall in the ground so suddenly that
Gandalf s horse nearly slipped down the slope.</p>
<p>"Here it is at last!" he called, and the others gathered round him
and looked over the edge. They saw a valley far below. They could hear the voice
of hurrying water in rocky bed at the bottom; the scent of trees was in the air;
and there was a light on the valley-side across the water. Bilbo never forgot
the way they slithered and slipped in the dusk down the steep zig-zag path into
the secret valley of Rivendell. The air grew warmer as they got lower, and the
smell of the pine-trees made him drowsy, so that every now and again he nodded
and nearly fell off, or bumped his nose on the pony's neck. Their spirits rose
as they went down and down. The trees changed to beech and oak, and hire was a
comfortable feeling in the twilight. The last green had almost faded out of the
grass, when they came at length to an open glade not far above the banks of the
stream.</p>
<p>"Hrnmm! it smells like elves!" thought Bilbo, and he looked up at
the stars. They were burning bright and blue. Just then there came a burst of
song like laughter in the trees:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O! What are you doing,</p>
<p>And where are you going?</p>
<p>Your ponies need shoeing!</p>
<p>The river is flowing!</p>
<p>O! tra-la-la-lally</p>
<p>here down in the valley!</p>
<p>O! What are you seeking,</p>
<p>And where are you making?</p>
<p>The faggots are reeking,</p>
<p>The bannocks are baking!</p>
<p>O! tril-lil-lil-lolly</p>
<p>the valley is jolly,</p>
<p>ha! ha!</p>
<p>O! Where are you going</p>
<p>With beards all a-wagging?</p>
<p>No knowing, no knowing</p>
<p>What brings Mister Baggins,</p>
<p>And Balin and Dwalin</p>
<p>down into the valley</p>
<p>in June</p>
<p>ha! ha!</p>
<p>O! Will you be staying,</p>
<p>Or will you be flying?</p>
<p>Your ponies are straying!</p>
<p>The daylight is dying!</p>
<p>To fly would be folly,</p>
<p>To stay would be jolly</p>
<p>And listen and hark</p>
<p>Till the end of the dark</p>
<p>to our tune</p>
<p>ha! ha.'</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>So they laughed and sang in the trees; and pretty fair nonsense I daresay you
think it. Not that they would care they would only laugh all the more if you
told them so. They were elves of course. Soon Bilbo caught glimpses of them as
the darkness deepened. He loved elves, though he seldom met them; but he was a
little frightened of them too. Dwarves don't get on well with them. Even decent
enough dwarves like Thorin and his friends think them foolish (which is a very
foolish thing to think), or get annoyed with them. For some elves tease them and
laugh at them, and most of all at their beards.</p>
<p>"Well, well!" said a voice. "Just look! Bilbo the hobbit on a
pony, my dear! Isn't it delicious!"</p>
<p>"Most astonishing wonderful!"</p>
<p>Then off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one I have written
down in full. At last one, a tall young fellow, came out from the trees and
bowed to Gandalf and to Thorin.</p>
<p>"Welcome to the valley!" he said.</p>
<p>"Thank you!" said Thorin a bit gruffly; but Gandalf was already off
his horse and among the elves, talking merrily with them.</p>
<p>"You are a little out of your way," said the elf: "that is, if
you are making for the only path across the water and to the house beyond. We
will set you right, but you had best get on foot, until you are over the bridge.
Are you going to stay a bit and sing with us, or will you go straight on? Supper
is preparing over there," he said. "I can smell the Wood-fires for the
cooking."</p>
<p>Tired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to stay awhile. Elvish singing is not
a thing to miss, in June under the stars, not if you care for such things. Also
he would have liked to have a few private words with these people that seemed to
know his name and all about him, although he had never been them before. He
thought their opinion of his adventure might be interesting. Elves know a lot
and are wondrous folk for news, and know what is going on among the peoples of
the land, as quick as water flows, or quicker. But the dwarves were all for
supper as soon 'as possible just then, and would not stay. On they all went,
leading their ponies, till they were brought to a good path and so at last to
the very brink of the river. It was flowing fast and noisily, as
mountain-streams do of a summer evening, when sun has been all day on the snow
far up above. There was only a narrow bridge of stone without a parapet, as
narrow as a pony could well walk on; and over that they had to go, slow and
careful, one by one, each leading his pony by the bridle. The elves had brought
bright lanterns to the shore, and they sang a merry song as the party went
across.</p>
<p>"Don't dip your beard in the foam, father!" they cried to Thorin,
who was bent almost on to his hands and knees. "It is long enough without
watering it."</p>
<p>"Mind Bilbo doesn't eat all the cakes!" they called. "He is
too fat to get through key-holes yet!"</p>
<p>"Hush, hush! Good People! and good night!" said Gandalf, who came
last. "Valleys have ears, and some elves have over merry tongues. Good
night!"</p>
<p>And so at last they all came to the Last Homely House, and found its doors
flung wide.</p>
<p>Now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are
good to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that
are uncomfortable, palpitating, and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and
take a deal of telling anyway. They stayed long in that good house, fourteen
days at least, and they found it hard to leave. Bilbo would gladly have stopped
there for ever and ever-even supposing a wish would have taken him right back to
his hobbit-hole without trouble. Yet there is little to tell about their stay.</p>
<p>The master of the house was an elf-friend-one of those people whose fathers
came into the strange stories before the beginning of History, the wars of the
evil goblins and the elves and the first men in the North. In those days of our
tale there were still some people who had both elves and heroes of the North for
ancestors, and Elrond the master of the house was their chief. He was as noble
and as fair in face as an elf-lord, as strong as a warrior, as wise as a wizard,
as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as summer. He comes into. many
tales, but his part in the story of Bilbo's great adventure is only a small one,
though important, as you will see, if we ever get to the end of it. His house
was perfect, whether you liked food, or sleep, or work, or story-telling, or
singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all.
Evil things did not come into that valley.</p>
<p>I wish I had time to tell you even a few of the tales or one or two of the
songs that they heard in that house. All of them, the ponies as well, grew
refreshed and strong in a few days there. Their clothes were mended as well as
their bruises, their tempers and their hopes. Their bags were filled with food
and provisions light to carry but strong to bring them over the mountain passes.
Their plans were improved with the best advice. So the time came to midsummer
eve, and they were to go on again with the early sun on midsummer morning.</p>
<p>Elrond knew all about runes of every kind. That day he looked at the swords
they had brought from the trolls' lair, and he said: "These are not
troll-make. They are old swords, very old swords of the High Elves of the West,
my kin. They were made in Gondolin for the Goblin-wars. They must have come from
a dragon's hoard or goblin plunder, for dragons and goblins destroyed that city
many ages ago. This, Thorin, the runes name Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver in the
ancient tongue of Gondolin; it was a famous blade. This, Gandalf, was Glamdring,
Foe-hammer that the king of Gondolin once wore. Keep them well!"</p>
<p>"Whence did the trolls get them, I wonder?" said Thorin looking at
his sword with new interest.</p>
<p>"I could not say," said Elrond, "but one may guess that your
trolls had plundered other plunderers, or come on the remnants of old robberies
in some hold in the mountains of the North. I have heard that there are still
forgotten treasures of old to be found in the deserted caverns of the mines of
Moria, since the dwarf and goblin war."</p>
<p>Thorin pondered these words. "I will keep this sword in honour," he
said. "May it soon cleave goblins once again!"</p>
<p>"A wish that is likely to be granted soon enough in the mountains!"
said Elrond. "But show me now your map!" He took it and gazed long at
it, and he shook his head; for if he did not altogether approve of dwarves and
their love of gold, he hated dragons and their cruel wickedness, and he grieved
to remember the ruin of the town of Dale and its merry bells, and the burned
banks of the bright River Running. The moon was shining in a broad silver
crescent. He held up the map and the white light shone through it. "What is
this?" he said. "There are moon-letters here, beside the plain runes
which say 'five feet high the door and three may walk abreast.' "</p>
<p>"What are moon-letters?" asked the hobbit full of excitement. He
loved maps, as I have told you before; and he also liked runes and letters and
cunning handwriting, though when he wrote himself it was a bit thin and spidery.</p>
<p>"Moon-letters are rune-letters, but you cannot see them," said
Elrond, "not when you look straight at them. They can only be seen when the
moon shines behind them, and what is more, with the more cunning sort it must be
a moon of the same shape and season as the day when they were written. The
dwarves invented them and wrote them with silver pens, as your friends could
tell you. These must have been written on a midsummer's eve in a crescent moon,
a long while ago."</p>
<p>"What do they say?" asked Gandalf and Thorin together, a bit vexed
perhaps that even Elrond should have found this out first, though really there
had not been a chance before, and there would not have been another until
goodness knows when.</p>
<p>"Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks," read Elrond,
"and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the
key-hole."</p>
<p>"Durin, Durin!" said Thorin. "He was the father of the fathers
of the eldest race of Dwarves, the Longbeards, and my first ancestor: I am his
heir."</p>
<p>"Then what is Durin's Day?" asked Elrond.</p>
<p>"The first day of the dwarves' New Year," said Thorin, "is as
all should know the first, day of the last moon of Autumn on the threshold of
Winter. We still call it Durin's Day when the last moon of Autumn and the sun
are in the sky together. But this will not help us much, I fear, for it passes
our skill in these days to guess when such a time will come again."</p>
<p>"That remains to be seen," said Gandalf. "Is there any more
writing?"</p>
<p>"None to be seen by this moon," said Elrond, and he gave the map
back to Thorin; and then they went down to the water to see the elves dance and
sing upon the midsummer's eve.</p>
<p>The next morning was a midsummer's morning as fair and fresh as could be
dreamed: blue sky and never a cloud, and the sun dancing on the water. Now they
rode away amid songs of farewell and good speed, with their hearts ready for
more adventure, and with a knowledge of the road they must follow over the Misty
Mountains to the land beyond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="04"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<h2>Over Hill and Under Hill</h2>
<p>There were many paths that led up into those mountains, and many passes over
them. But most of the paths were cheats and deceptions and led nowhere or to bad
ends; and most of the passes were infested by evil things and dreadful dangers.
The dwarves and the hobbit, helped by the wise advice of Elrond and the
knowledge and memory of Gandalf, took the right road to the right pass.</p>
<p>Long days after they had climbed out of the valley and left the Last Homely
House miles behind, they were still going up and up and up. It was a hard path
and a dangerous path, a crooked way and a lonely and a long. Now they could look
back over the lands they had left, laid out behind them far below. Far, far away
in the West, where things were blue and faint, Bilbo knew there lay his own
country of safe and comfortable things, and his little hobbit-hole. He shivered.
It was getting bitter cold up here, and the wind came shrill among the rocks.
Boulders, too, at times came galloping down the mountain-sides, let loose by
midday sun upon the snow, and passed among them (which was lucky), or over their
heads (which was alarming). The nights were comfortless and chill, and they did
not dare to sing or talk too loud, for the echoes were uncanny, and the silence
seemed to dislike being broken-except by the noise of water and the wail of wind
and the crack of stone.</p>
<p>"The summer is getting on down below," thought Bilbo, "and
haymaking is going on and picnics. They will be harvesting and blackberrying,
before we even begin to go down the other side at this rate." And the
others were thinking equally gloomy thoughts, although when they had said
good-bye to Elrond in the high hope of a midsummer morning, they' had spoken
gaily of the passage of the mountains, and of riding swift across the lands
beyond. They had thought of coming to the secret door in the Lonely Mountain,
perhaps that very next first moon of Autumn-" and perhaps it will be
Durin's Day" they had said. Only Gandalf had shaken his head and said
nothing. Dwarves had not passed that way for many years, but Gandalf had, and he
knew how evil and danger had grown and thriven in the Wild, since the dragons
had driven men from the lands, and the goblins had spread in secret after the
battle of the Mines of Moria. Even the good plans of wise wizards like Gandalf
and of good friends like Elrond go astray sometimes when you are off on
dangerous adventures over the Edge of the Wild; and Gandalf was a wise enough
wizard to know it.</p>
<p>He knew that something unexpected might happen, and he hardly dared to hope
that they would pass without fearful adventure over those great tall mountains
with lonely peaks and valleys where no king ruled. They did not. All was well,
until one day they met a thunderstorm - more than a thunderstorm, a
thunder-battle. You know how terrific a really big thunderstorm can be down in
the land and in a river-valley; especially at times when two great thunderstorms
meet and clash. More terrible still are thunder and lightning in the mountains
at night, when storms come up from East and West and make war. The lightning
splinters on the peaks, and rocks shiver, and great crashes split the air and go
rolling and tumbling into every cave and hollow; and the darkness is filled with
overwhelming noise and sudden light.</p>
<p>Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind. They were high up in a
narrow place, with a dreadful fall into a dim valley at one side of them. There
they were sheltering under a hanging rock for the night, and he lay beneath a
blanket and shook from head to toe. When he peeped out in the lightning-flashes,
he saw that across the valley the stone-giants were out and were hurling rocks
at one another for a. game, and catching them, and tossing them down into the
darkness where they smashed among the trees far below, or splintered into little
bits with a bang. Then came a wind and a rain, and the wind whipped the rain and
the hail about in every direction, so that an overhanging rock was no protection
at all. Soon they were getting drenched and their ponies were standing with
their heads down and their tails between their legs, and some of them were
whinnying with fright. They could hear the giants guffawing and shouting all
over the mountainsides.</p>
<p>"This won't do at all!" said Thorin. "If we don't get blown
off or drowned, or struck by lightning, we shall be picked up by some giant and
kicked sky-high for a football."</p>
<p>"Well, if you know of anywhere better, take us there!" said
Gandalf, who was feeling very grumpy, and was far from happy about the giants
himself.</p>
<p>The end of their argument was that they sent Fill and Kili to look for a
better shelter. They had very sharp eyes, and being the youngest of the dwarves
by some fifty years they usually got these sort of jobs (when everybody could
see that it was absolutely no use sending Bilbo). There is nothing like looking,
if you want to find something (or so Thorin said to the young dwarves). You
certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the
something you were after. So it proved on this occasion.</p>
<p>Soon Fili and Kili came crawling back, holding on to the rocks in the wind.
"We have found a dry cave," they said, "not far round the next
corner; and ponies and all could get inside."</p>
<p>"Have you thoroughly explored it?" said the wizard, who knew that
caves up in the mountains were seldom unoccupied.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!" they said, though everybody knew they could not have
been long about it; they had come back too quick. "It isn't all that big,
and it does not go far back."</p>
<p>That, of course, is the dangerous part about caves: you don't know how far
they go back, sometimes, or where a passage behind may lead to, or what is
waiting for you inside. But now Fili and Kill's news seemed good enough. So they
all got up and prepared to move. The wind was howling and the thunder still
growling, and they had a business getting themselves and their ponies along.
Still it was not very far to go, and before long they came to a big rock
standing out into the path. If you stepped behind, you found a low arch in the
side of the mountain. There was just room to get the ponies through with a
squeeze, when they had been unpacked and unsaddled. As they passed under the
arch, it was good to hear the wind and the rain outside instead of all about
them, and to feel safe from the giants and their rocks. But the wizard was
taking no risks. He lit up his wand - as he did that day in Bilbo's dining-room
that seemed so long ago, if you remember-, and by its light they explored the
cave from end to end.</p>
<p>It seemed quite a fair size, but not too large and mysterious. It had a dry
floor and some comfortable nooks. At one end there was room for the ponies; and
there they stood (mighty glad of the change) steaming, and champing in their
nosebags. Oin and Gloin wanted to light a fire at the door to dry their clothes,
but Gandalf would not hear of it. So they spread out their wet things on the
floor, and got dry ones out of their bundles; then they made their blankets
comfortable, got out their pipes and blew smoke rings, which Gandalf turned into
different colours and set dancing up by the roof to amuse them. They talked and
talked, and forgot about the storm, and discussed what each would do with his
share of the treasure (when they got it, which at the moment did not seem so
impossible); and so they dropped off to sleep one by one. And that was the last
time that they used the ponies, packages, baggages, tools and paraphernalia that
they had brought with them.</p>
<p>It turned out a good thing that night that they had brought little Bilbo with
them, after all. For somehow, he could not go to sleep for a long while; and
when he did sleep, he had very nasty dreams. He dreamed that a crack in the wall
at the back of the cave got bigger and bigger, and opened wider and wider, and
he was very afraid but could not call out or do anything but lie and look. Then
he dreamed that the floor of the cave was giving way, and he was
slipping-beginning to fall down, down, goodness knows where to.</p>
<p>At that he woke up with a horrible start, and found that part of his dream
was true. A crack had opened at the back of the cave, and was already a wide
passage. He was just in time to see the last of the ponies' tails disappearing
into it. Of course he gave a very loud yell, as loud a yell as a hobbit can
give, which is surprising for their size.</p>
<p>Out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great ugly-looking goblins, lots of
goblins, before you could say rocks and blocks. There were six to each dwarf, at
least, and two even for Bilbo; and they were all grabbed and carried through the
crack, before you could say tinder and flint. But not Gandalf. Bilbo's yell had
done that much good. It had wakened him up wide in a splintered second, and when
goblins came to grab him, there was a terrible flash like lightning in the cave,
a smell like gunpowder, and several of them fell dead.</p>
<p>The crack closed with a snap, and Bilbo and the dwarves were on the wrong
side of it! Where was Gandalf? Of that neither they nor the goblins had any
idea, and the goblins did not wait to find out. It was deep, deep, dark, such as
only goblins that have taken to living in the heart of the mountains can see
through. The passages there were crossed and tangled in all directions, but the
goblins knew their way, as well as you do to the nearest post-office; and the
way went down and down, and it was most horribly stuffy. The goblins were very
rough, and pinched unmercifully, and chuckled and laughed in their horrible
stony voices; and Bilbo was more unhappy even than when the troll had picked him
up by his toes. He wished again and again for his nice bright hobbit-hole. Not
for the last time.</p>
<p>Now there came a glimmer of a red light before them. The goblins began to
sing, or croak, keeping time with the flap of their flat feet on the stone, and
shaking their prisoners as well.</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Clap! Snap! the black crack!</p>
<p>Grip, grab! Pinch, nab!</p>
<p>And down down to Goblin-town</p>
<p>You go, my lad!</p>
<p>Clash, crash! Crush, smash!</p>
<p>Hammer and tongs! Knocker and gongs!</p>
<p>Pound, pound, far underground!</p>
<p>Ho, ho! my lad!</p>
<p>Swish, smack! Whip crack!</p>
<p>Batter and beat! Yammer and bleat!</p>
<p>Work, work! Nor dare to shirk,</p>
<p>While Goblins quaff, and Goblins laugh,</p>
<p>Round and round far underground</p>
<p>Below, my lad!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>It sounded truly terrifying. The walls echoed to the clap, snap! and the
crush, smash! and to the ugly laughter of their ho, ho! my lad! The general
meaning of the song was only too plain; for now the goblins took out whips and
whipped them with a swish, smack!, and set them running as fast as they could in
front of them; and more than one of the dwarves were already yammering and
bleating like anything, when they stumbled into a big cavern.</p>
<p>It was lit by a great red fire in the middle, and by torches along the walls,
and it was full of goblins. They all laughed and stamped and clapped their
hands, when the dwarves (with poor little Bilbo at the back and nearest to the
whips) came running in, while the goblin-drivers whooped and cracked their whips
behind. The ponies were already there huddled in a corner; and there were all
the baggages and packages lying broken open, and being rummaged by goblins, and
smelt by goblins, and fingered by goblins, and quarreled over by goblins.</p>
<p>I am afraid that was the last they ever saw of those excellent little ponies,
including a jolly sturdy little white fellow that Elrond had lent to Gandalf,
since his horse was not suitable for the mountain-paths. For goblins eat horses
and ponies and donkeys (and other much more dreadful things), and they are
always hungry. Just now however the prisoners were thinking only of themselves.
The goblins chained their hands behind their backs and linked them all together
in a line and dragged them to the far end of the cavern with little Bilbo
tugging at the end of the row.</p>
<p>There in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a
huge head, and armed goblins were standing round him carrying the axes and the
bent swords that they use. Now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted. They
make no beautiful things, but they make many clever ones. They can tunnel and
mine as well as any but the most skilled dwarves, when they take the trouble,
though they are usually untidy and dirty. Hammers, axes, swords, daggers,
pickaxes, tongs, and also instruments of torture, they make very well, or get
other people to make to their design, prisoners and slaves that have to work
till they die for want of air and light. It is not unlikely that they invented
some of the machines that have since troubled the world, especially the
ingenious devices for killing large numbers of people at once, for wheels and
engines and explosions always delighted them, and also not working with their
own hands more than they could help; but in those days and those wild parts they
had not advanced (as it is called) so far. They did not hate dwarves especially,
no more than they hated everybody and everything, and particularly the orderly
and prosperous; in some parts wicked dwarves had even made alliances with them.
But they had a special grudge against Thorin's people, because of the war which
you have heard mentioned, but which does not come into this tale; and anyway
goblins don't care who they catch, as long as it is done smart and secret, and
the prisoners are not able to defend themselves.</p>
<p>"Who are these miserable persons?" said the Great Goblin.</p>
<p>"Dwarves, and this!" said one of the drivers, pulling at Bilbo's
chain so that he fell forward onto his knees.</p>
<p>"We found them sheltering in our Front Porch."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by it?" said the Great Goblin turning to Thorin.
"Up to no good, I'll warrant! Spying on the private business of my people,
I guess! Thieves, I shouldn't be surprised to learn! Murderers and friends of
Elves, not unlikely! Come! What have you got to say?"</p>
<p>"Thorin the dwarf at your service!" he replied-it was merely a
polite nothing. "Of the things which you suspect and imagine we had no idea
at all. We sheltered from a storm in what seemed a convenient cave and unused;
nothing was further from our thoughts than inconveniencing goblins in any way
whatever." That was true enough!</p>
<p>"Urn!" said the Great Goblin. "So you say! Might I ask what
you were doing up in the mountains at all, and where you were coming from, and
where you were going to? In fact I should like to know all about you. Not that
it will do you much good, Thorin Oakenshield, I know too much about your folk
already; but let's have the truth, or I will prepare something particularly
uncomfortable for you!"</p>
<p>"We were on a journey to visit our relatives, our nephews and nieces,
and first, second, and third cousins, and the other descendants of our
grandfathers, who live on the East side of these truly hospitable
mountains," said Thorin, not quite knowing what to say all at once in a
moment, when obviously the exact truth would not do at all.</p>
<p>"He is a liar, O truly tremendous one!" said one of the drivers.
"Several of our people were struck by lightning in the cave, when we
invited these creatures to come below; and they are as dead as stones. Also he
has not explained this!" He held out the sword which Thorin had worn, the
sword which came from the Trolls' lair.</p>
<p>The Great Goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he looked at it, and
all his soldiers gnashed their teeth, clashed their shields, and stamped. They
knew the sword at once. It had killed hundreds of goblins in its time, when the
fair elves of Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their
walls. They had called it Orcrist, Goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it
simply Biter. They hated it and hated worse any one that carried it.</p>
<p>"Murderers' and elf-friends!" the Great Goblin shouted. "Slash
them! Beat them! Bite them! Gnash them! Take them away to dark holes full of
snakes, and never let them see the light again!" He was in such a rage that
he jumped off his seat and himself rushed at Thorin with his mouth open.</p>
<p>Just at that moment all the lights in the cavern went out, and the great fire
went off poof! into a tower of blue glowing smoke, right up to the roof, that
scattered piercing white sparks all among the goblins.</p>
<p>The yells and yammering, croaking, jibbering and jabbering; howls, growls and
curses; shrieking and skriking, that followed were beyond description. Several
hundred wild cats and wolves being roasted slowly alive together would not have
compared with it. The sparks were burning holes in the goblins, and the smoke
that now fell from the roof made the air too thick for even their eyes to see
through. Soon they were falling over one another and rolling in heaps on the
floor, biting and kicking and fighting as if they had all gone mad.</p>
<p>Suddenly a sword flashed in its own light. Bilbo saw it go right through the
Great Goblin as he stood dumbfounded in the middle of his rage. He fell dead,
and the goblin soldiers fled before the sword shrieking into the darkness.</p>
<p>The sword went back into its sheath. "Follow me quick!" said a
voice fierce and quiet; and before Bilbo understood what had happened he was
trotting along again, as fast as he could trot, at the end of the line, down
more dark passages with the yells of the goblin-hall growing fainter behind him.
A pale light was leading them on.</p>
<p>"Quicker, quicker!" said the voice. "The torches will soon be
relit."</p>
<p>"Half a minute!" said Dori, who was at the back next to Bilbo, and
a decent fellow. He made the hobbit scramble on his shoulders as best he could
with his tied hands, and then off they all went at a run, with a clink-clink of
chains, and many a stumble, since they had no hands to steady themselves with.
Not for a long while did they stop, and by that time they must have been right
down in the very mountain's heart.</p>
<p>Then Gandalf lit up his wand. Of course it was Gandalf; but just then they
were too busy to ask how he got there. He took out his sword again, and again it
flashed in the dark by itself. It burned with a rage that made it gleam if
goblins were about; now it was bright as blue flame for delight in the killing
of the great lord of the cave. It made no trouble whatever of cutting through
the goblin-chains and setting all the prisoners free as quickly as possible.
This sword's name was Glamdring the Foe-hammer, if you remember. The goblins
just called it Beater, and hated it worse than Biter if possible. Orcrist, too,
had been saved; for Gandalf had brought it along as well, snatching it from one
of the terrified guards. Gandalf thought of most things; and though he could not
do everything, he could do a great deal for friends in a tight comer.</p>
<p>"Are we all here?" said he, handing his sword back to Thorin with a
bow. "Let me see: one-that's Thorin; two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven; where are Fili and Kili? Here they are, twelve,
thirteen-and here's Mr. Baggins: fourteen! Well, well! it might be worse, and
then again it might be a good deal better. No ponies, and no food, and no
knowing quite where we are, and hordes of angry goblins just behind! On we
go!"</p>
<p>On they went. Gandalf was quite right: they began to hear goblin noises and
horrible cries far behind in the passages they had come through. That sent them
on faster than ever, and as poor Bilbo could not possibly go half as fast-for
dwarves can roll along at a tremendous pace, I can tell you, when they have
to-they took it in turn to carry him on their backs.</p>
<p>Still goblins go faster than dwarves, and these goblins knew the way better
(they had made the paths themselves), and were madly angry; so that do what they
could the dwarves heard the cries and howls getting closer and closer. Soon they
could hear even the flap of the goblin feet, many many feet which seemed only
just round the last corner. The blink of red torches could be seen behind them
in the tunnel they were following; and they were getting deadly tired.</p>
<p>"Why, O why did I ever leave my hobbit-hole!" said poor Mr. Baggins
bumping up and down on Bombur's back.</p>
<p>"Why, O why did I ever bring a wretched little hobbit on a treasure
hunt!" said poor Bombur, who was fat, and staggered along with the sweat
dripping down his nose in his heat and terror.</p>
<p>At this point Gandalf fell behind, and Thorin with him. They turned a sharp
corner. "About turn!" he shouted. "Draw your sword, Thorin!"</p>
<p>There was nothing else to be done; and the goblins did not like it. They came
scurrying round the corner in full cry, and found Goblin-cleaver and Foe-hammer
shining cold and bright right in their astonished eyes. The ones in front
dropped their torches and gave one yell before they were killed. The ones behind
yelled still more, and leaped back knocking over those that were running after
them. "Biter and Beater!" they shrieked; and soon they were all in
confusion, and most of them were hustling back the way they had come.</p>
<p>It was quite a long while before any of them dared to turn that comer. By
that time the dwarves had gone on again, a long, long, way on into the dark
tunnels of the goblins' realm. When the goblins discovered that, they put out
their torches and they slipped on soft shoes, and they chose out their very
quickest runners with the sharpest ears and eyes. These ran forward, as swift as
weasels in the dark, and with hardly any more noise than bats.</p>
<p>That is why neither Bilbo, nor the dwarves, nor even Gandalf heard them
coming. Nor did they see them. But they were seen by the goblins that ran
silently up behind, for Gandalf was letting his wand give out a faint light to
help the dwarves as they went along.</p>
<p>Quite suddenly Dori, now at the back again carrying Bilbo, was grabbed from
behind in the dark. He shouted and fell; and the hobbit rolled off his shoulders
into the blackness, bumped his head on hard rock, and remembered nothing more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="05"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<h2>Riddles in the Dark</h2>
<p>When Bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered if he had; for it was just as dark as
with them shut. No one was anywhere near him. Just imagine his fright! He could
hear nothing, see nothing, and he could feel nothing except the stone of the
floor.</p>
<p>Very slowly he got up and groped about on all fours, till he touched the wall
of the tunnel; but neither up nor down it could he find anything: nothing at
all, no sign of goblins, no sign of dwarves. His head was swimming, and he was
far from certain even of the direction they had been going in when he had his
fall. He guessed as well as he could, and crawled along for a good way, till
suddenly his hand met what felt like a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the
floor of the tunnel. It was a turning point in his career, but he did not know
it. He put the ring in his pocket almost without thinking; certainly it did not
seem of any particular use at the moment. He did not go much further, but sat
down on the cold floor and gave himself up to complete miserableness, for a long
while. He thought of himself frying bacon and eggs in his own kitchen at home -
for he could feel inside that it was high time for some meal or other; but that
only made him miserabler.</p>
<p>He could not think what to do; nor could he think what had happened; or why
he had been left behind; or why, if he had been left behind, the goblins had not
caught him; or even why his head was so sore. The truth was he had been lying
quiet, out of sight and out of mind, in a very dark corner for a long while.</p>
<p>After some time he felt for his pipe. It was not broken, and that was
something. Then he felt for his pouch, and there was some tobacco in it, and
that was something more. Then he felt for matches and he could not find any at
all, and that shattered his hopes completely. Just as well for him, as he agreed
when he came to his senses. Goodness knows what the striking of matches and the
smell of tobacco would have brought on him out of dark holes in that horrible
place. Still at the moment he felt very crushed. But in slapping all his pockets
and feeling all round himself for matches his hand came on the hilt of his
little sword - the little dagger that he got from the trolls, and that he had
quite forgotten; nor do the goblins seem to have noticed it, as he wore it
inside his breeches.</p>
<p>Now he drew it out. It shone pale and dim before his eyes. "So it is an
elvish blade, too," he thought; "and goblins are not very near, and
yet not far enough."</p>
<p>But somehow he was comforted. It was rather splendid to be wearing a blade
made in Gondolin for the goblin-wars of which so many songs had sung; and also
he had noticed that such weapons made a great impression on goblins that came
upon them suddenly.</p>
<p>"Go back?" he thought. "No good at all! Go sideways?
Impossible! Go forward? Only thing to do! On we go!" So up he got, and
trotted along with his little sword held in front of him and one hand feeling
the wall, and his heart all of a patter and a pitter.</p>
<p>Now certainly Bilbo was in what is called a tight place. But you must
remember it was not quite so tight for him as it would have been for me or for
you. Hobbits are not quite like ordinary people; and after all if their holes
are nice cheery places and properly aired, quite different from the tunnels of
the goblins, still they are more used to tunnelling than we are, and they do not
easily lose their sense of direction underground-not when their heads have
recovered from being bumped. Also they can move very quietly, and hide easily,
and recover wonderfully from falls and bruises, and they have a fund of wisdom
and wise sayings that men have mostly never heard or have forgotten long ago.</p>
<p>I should not have liked to have been in Mr. Baggins' place, all the same. The
tunnel seemed to have no end. All he knew was that it was still going down
pretty steadily and keeping in the same direction in spite of a twist and a turn
or two. There were passages leading off to the side every now and then, as he
knew by the glimmer of his sword, or could feel with his hand on the wall. Of
these he took no notice, except to hurry past for fear of goblins or
half-imagined dark things coming out of them. On and on he went, and down and
down; and still he heard no sound of anything except the occasional whirr of a
bat by his ears, which startled him at first, till it became too frequent to
bother about. I do not know how long he kept on like this, hating to go on, not
daring to stop, on, on, until he was tireder than tired. It seemed like all the
way to tomorrow and over it to the days beyond.</p>
<p>Suddenly without any warning he trotted splash into water! Ugh! it was icy
cold. That pulled him up sharp and short. He did not know whether it was just a
pool in the path, or the edge of an underground stream that crossed the passage,
or the brink of a deep dark subterranean lake. The sword was hardly shining at
all. He stopped, and he could hear, when he listened hard, drops
drip-drip-dripping from an unseen roof into the water below; but there seemed no
other sort of sound.</p>
<p>"So it is a pool or a lake, and not an underground river," he
thought. Still he did not dare to wade out into the darkness. He could not swim;
and he thought, too, of nasty slimy things, with big bulging blind eyes,
wriggling in the water. There are strange things living in the pools and lakes
in the hearts of mountains: fish whose fathers swam in, goodness only knows how
many years ago, and never swam out again, while their eyes grew bigger and
bigger and bigger from trying to see in the blackness; also there are other
things more slimy than fish. Even in the tunnels and caves the goblins have made
for themselves there are other things living unbeknown to them that have sneaked
in from outside to lie up in the dark. Some of these caves, too, go back in
their beginnings to ages before the goblins, who only widened them and joined
them up with passages, and the original owners are still there in odd comers,
slinking and nosing about.</p>
<p>Deep down here by the dark water lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature. I
don't know where he came from, nor who or what he was. He was Gollum - as dark
as darkness, except for two big round pale eyes in his thin face. He had a
little boat, and he rowed about quite quietly on the lake; for lake it was, wide
and deep and deadly cold. He paddled it with large feet dangling over the side,
but never a ripple did he make. Not he. He was looking out of his pale lamp-like
eyes for blind fish, which he grabbed with his long fingers as quick as
thinking. He liked meat too. Goblin he thought good, when he could get it; but
he took care they never found him out. He just throttled them from behind, if
they ever came down alone anywhere near the edge of the water, while he was
prowling about. They very seldom did, for they had a feeling that something
unpleasant was lurking down there, down at the very roots of the mountain. They
had come on the lake, when they were tunnelling down long ago, and they found
they could go no further; so there their road ended in that direction, and there
was no reason to go that way - unless the Great Goblin sent them. Sometimes he
took a fancy for fish from the lake, and sometimes neither goblin nor fish came
back.</p>
<p>Actually Gollum lived on a slimy island of rock in the middle of the lake. He
was watching Bilbo now from the distance with his pale eyes like telescopes.
Bilbo could not see him, but he was wondering a lot about Bilbo, for he could
see that he was no goblin at all.</p>
<p>Gollum got into his boat and shot off from the island, while Bilbo was
sitting on the brink altogether flummoxed and at the end of his way and his
wits. Suddenly up came Gollum and whispered and hissed:</p>
<p>"Bless us and splash us, my precioussss! I guess it's a choice feast; at
least a tasty morsel it'd make us, gollum!" And when he said <i>gollum</i>
he made a horrible swallowing noise in his throat. That is how he got his name,
though he always called himself 'my precious.'</p>
<p>The hobbit jumped nearly out of his skin when the hiss came in his ears, and
he suddenly saw the pale eyes sticking out at him.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" he said, thrusting his dagger in front of him.</p>
<p>"What iss he, my preciouss?" whispered Gollum (who always spoke to
himself through never having anyone else to speak to). This is what he had come
to find out, for he was not really very hungry at the moment, only curious;
otherwise he would have grabbed first and whispered afterwards.</p>
<p>"I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins. I have lost the dwarves and I have lost the
wizard, and I don't know where I am; and I don't want to know, if only I can get
away."</p>
<p>"What's he got in his handses?" said Gollum, looking at the sword,
which he did not quite like.</p>
<p>"A sword, a blade which came out of Gondolin!"</p>
<p>"Sssss," said Gollum, and became quite polite. "Praps ye sits
here and chats with it a bitsy, my preciousss. It like riddles, praps it does,
does it?" He was anxious to appear friendly, at any rate for the moment,
and until he found out more about the sword and the hobbit, whether he was quite
alone really, whether he was good to eat, and whether Gollum was really hungry.
Riddles were all he could think of. Asking them, and sometimes guessing them,
had been the only game he had ever played with other funny creatures sitting in
their holes in the long, long ago, before he lost all his friends and was driven
away, alone, and crept down, down, into the dark under the mountains.</p>
<p>"Very well," said Bilbo, who was anxious to agree, until he found
out more about the creature, whether he was quite alone, whether he was fierce
or hungry, and whether he was a friend of the goblins.</p>
<p>"You ask first," he said, because he had not had time to think of a
riddle.</p>
<p>So Gollum hissed:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What has roots as nobody sees,</p>
<p>Is taller than trees,</p>
<p>Up, up it goes,</p>
<p>And yet never grows?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>"Easy!" said Bilbo. "Mountain, I suppose."</p>
<p>"Does it guess easy? It must have a competition with us, my preciouss!
If precious asks, and it doesn't answer, we eats it, my preciousss. If it asks
us, and we doesn't answer, then we does what it wants, eh? We shows it the way
out, yes!"</p>
<p>"All right!" said Bilbo, not daring to disagree, and nearly
bursting his brain to think of riddles that could save him from being eaten.</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thirty white horses on a red hill,</p>
<p>First they champ,</p>
<p>Then they stamp,</p>
<p>Then they stand still.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>That was all he could think of to ask - the idea of eating was rather on his
mind. It was rather an old one, too, and Gollum knew the answer as well as you
do.</p>
<p>"Chestnuts, chestnuts," he hissed. "Teeth! teeth! my
preciousss; but we has only six!" Then he asked his second:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Voiceless it cries,</p>
<p>Wingless flutters,</p>
<p>Toothless bites,</p>
<p>Mouthless mutters.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>"Half a moment!" cried Bilbo, who was still thinking uncomfortably
about eating. Fortunately he had once heard something rather like this before,
and getting his wits back he thought of the answer. "Wind, wind of
course," he said, and he was so pleased that he made up one on the spot.
"This'll puzzle the nasty little underground creature," he thought:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An eye in a blue face</p>
<p>Saw an eye in a green face.</p>
<p>"That eye is like to this eye"</p>
<p>Said the first eye,</p>
<p>"But in low place,</p>
<p>Not in high place."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>"Ss, ss, ss," said Gollum. He had been underground a long long
time, and was forgetting this sort of thing. But just as Bilbo was beginning to
hope that the wretch would not be able to answer, Gollum brought up memories of
ages and ages and ages before, when he lived with his grandmother in a hole in a
bank by a river, "Sss, sss, my preciouss," he said. "Sun on the
daisies it means, it does."</p>
<p>But these ordinary aboveground everyday sort of riddles were tiring for him.
Also they reminded him of days when he had been less lonely and sneaky and
nasty, and that put him out of temper. What is more they made him hungry; so
this time he tried something a bit more difficult and more unpleasant:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,</p>
<p>Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.</p>
<p>It lies behind stars and under hills,</p>
<p>And empty holes it fills.</p>
<p>It comes first and follows after,</p>
<p>Ends life, kills laughter.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>Unfortunately for Gollum Bilbo had heard that sort of thing before; and the
answer was all round him anyway. "Dark!" he said without even
scratching his head or putting on his thinking cap.</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A box without hinges, key, or lid,</p>
<p>Yet golden treasure inside is hid,</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>he asked to gain time, until he could think of a really hard one. This he
thought a dreadfully easy chestnut, though he had not asked it in the usual
words. But it proved a nasty poser for Gollum. He hissed to himself, and still
he did not answer; he whispered and spluttered.</p>
<p>After some while Bilbo became impatient. "Well, what is it?" he
said. "The answer's not a kettle boiling over, as you seem to think from
the noise you are making."</p>
<p>"Give us a chance; let it give us a chance, my preciouss-ss-ss."</p>
<p>"Well," said Bilbo, after giving him a long chance, "what
about your guess?"</p>
<p>But suddenly Gollum remembered thieving from nests long ago, and sitting
under the river bank teaching his grandmother, teaching his grandmother to suck
- "Eggses!" he hissed. "Eggses it is!" Then he asked:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alive without breath,</p>
<p>As cold as death;</p>
<p>Never thirsty, ever drinking,</p>
<p>All in mail never clinking.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>He also in his turn thought this was a dreadfully easy one, because he was
always thinking of the answer. But he could not remember anything better at the
moment, he was so flustered by the egg-question. All the same it was a poser for
poor Bilbo, who never had anything to do with the water if he could help it. I
imagine you know the answer, of course, or can guess it as easy as winking,
since you are sitting comfortably at home and have not the danger of being eaten
to disturb your thinking. Bilbo sat and cleared his throat once or twice, but no
answer came.</p>
<p>After a while Gollum began to hiss with pleasure to himself: "Is it
nice, my preciousss? Is it juicy? Is it scrumptiously crunchable?" He began
to peer at Bilbo out of the darkness.</p>
<p>"Half a moment," said the hobbit shivering. "I gave you a good
long chance just now."</p>
<p>"It must make haste, haste!" said Gollum, beginning to climb out of
his boat on to the shore to get at Bilbo. But when he put his long webby foot in
the water, a fish jumped out in a fright and fell on Bilbo's toes.</p>
<p>"Ugh!" he said, "it is cold and clammy!" - and so he
guessed. "Fish! Fish!" he cried. "It is fish!"</p>
<p>Gollum was dreadfully disappointed; but Bilbo asked another riddle as quick
as ever he could, so that Gollum had to get back into his boat and think.</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No-legs lay on one-leg, two-legs sat near on three-legs, four-legs got some.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>It was not really the right time for this riddle, but Bilbo was in a hurry.
Gollum might have had some trouble guessing it, if he had asked it at another
time. As it was, talking of fish, "no-legs" was not so very difficult,
and after that the rest was easy. "Fish on a little table, man at table
sitting on a stool, the cat has the bones" - that of course is the answer,
and Gollum soon gave it. Then he thought the time had come to ask something hard
and horrible. This is what he said:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This thing all things devours:</p>
<p>Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;</p>
<p>Gnaws iron, bites steel;</p>
<p>Grinds hard stones to meal;</p>
<p>Slays king, ruins town,</p>
<p>And beats high mountain down.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>Poor Bilbo sat in the dark thinking of all the horrible names of all the
giants and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales, but not one of them had
done all these things. He had a feeling that the answer was quite different and
that he ought to know it, but he could not think of it. He began to get
frightened, and that is bad for thinking. Gollum began to get out of his boat.
He flapped into the water and paddled to the bank; Bilbo could see his eyes
coming towards him. His tongue seemed to stick in his mouth; he wanted to shout
out: "Give me more time! Give me time!" But all that came out with a
sudden squeal was:</p>
<p>"Time! Time!"</p>
<p>Bilbo was saved by pure luck. For that of course was the answer.</p>
<p>Gollum was disappointed once more; and now he was getting angry, and also
tired of the game. It had made him very hungry indeed. This time he did not go
back to the boat. He sat down in the dark by Bilbo. That made the hobbit most
dreadfully uncomfortable and scattered his wits.</p>
<p>"It's got to ask uss a quesstion, my preciouss, yes, yess, yesss. Jusst
one more quesstion to guess, yes, yess," said Gollum.</p>
<p>But Bilbo simply could not think of any question with that nasty wet cold
thing sitting next to him, and pawing and poking him. He scratched himself, he
pinched himself; still he could not think of anything.</p>
<p>"Ask us! ask us!" said Gollum.</p>
<p>Bilbo pinched himself and slapped himself; he gripped on his little sword; he
even felt in his pocket with his other hand. There he found the ring he had
picked up in the passage and forgotten about.</p>
<p>"What have I got in my pocket?" he said aloud. He was talking to
himself, but Gollum thought it was a riddle, and he was frightfully upset.</p>
<p>"Not fair! not fair!" he hissed. "It isn't fair, my precious,
is it, to ask us what it's got in its nassty little pocketses?"</p>
<p>Bilbo seeing what had happened and having nothing better to ask stuck to his
question. "What have I got in my pocket?" he said louder.</p>
<p>"S-s-s-s-s," hissed Gollum. "It must give us three guesseses,
my preciouss, three guesseses."</p>
<p>"Very well! Guess away!" said Bilbo.</p>
<p>"Handses!" said Gollum.</p>
<p>"Wrong," said Bilbo, who had luckily just taken his hand out again.
"Guess again!"</p>
<p>"S-s-s-s-s," said Gollum more upset than ever. He thought of all
the things he kept in his own pockets: fishbones, goblins' teeth, wet shells, a
bit of bat-wing, a sharp stone to sharpen his fangs on, and other nasty things.
He tried to think what other people kept in their pockets.</p>
<p>"Knife!" he said at last.</p>
<p>"Wrong!" said Bilbo, who had lost his some time ago. "Last
guess!"</p>
<p>Now Gollum was in a much worse state than when Bilbo had asked him the
egg-question. He hissed and spluttered and rocked himself backwards and
forwards, and slapped his feet on the floor, and wriggled and squirmed; but
still he did not dare to waste his last guess.</p>
<p>"Come on!" said Bilbo. "I am waiting!" He tried to sound
bold and cheerful, but he did not feel at all sure how the game was going to
end, whether Gollum guessed right or not.</p>
<p>"Time's up!" he said.</p>
<p>"String, or nothing!" shrieked Gollum, which was not quite fair -
working in two guesses at once.</p>
<p>"Both wrong," cried Bilbo very much relieved; and he jumped at once
to his feet, put his back to the nearest wall, and held out his little sword. He
knew, of course, that the riddle-game was sacred and of immense antiquity, and
even wicked creatures were afraid to cheat when they played at it. But he felt
he could not trust this slimy thing to keep any promise at a pinch. Any excuse
would do for him to slide out of it. And after all that last question had not
been a genuine riddle according to the ancient laws.</p>
<p>But at any rate Gollum did not at once attack him. He could see the sword in
Bilbo's hand. He sat still, shivering and whispering. At last Bilbo could wait
no longer.</p>
<p>"Well?" he said. "What about your promise? I want to go. You
must show me the way."</p>
<p>"Did we say so, precious? Show the nassty little Baggins the way out,
yes, yes. But what has it got in its pocketses, eh? Not string, precious, but
not nothing. Oh no! gollum!"</p>
<p>"Never you mind," said Bilbo. "A promise is a promise."</p>
<p>"Cross it is, impatient, precious," hissed Gollum. "But it
must wait, yes it must. We can't go up the tunnels so hasty. We must go and get
some things first, yes, things to help us."</p>
<p>"Well, hurry up!" said Bilbo, relieved to think of Gollum going
away. He thought he was just making an excuse and did not mean to come back.
What was Gollum talking about? What useful thing could he keep out on the dark
lake? But he was wrong. Gollum did mean to come back. He was angry now and
hungry. And he was a miserable wicked creature, and already he had a plan.</p>
<p>Not far away was his island, of which Bilbo knew nothing, and there in his
hiding-place he kept a few wretched oddments, and one very beautiful thing, very
beautiful, very wonderful. He had a ring, a golden ring, a precious ring.</p>
<p>"My birthday-present!" he whispered to himself, as he had often
done in the endless dark days. "That's what we wants now, yes; we wants
it!"</p>
<p>He wanted it because it was a ring of power, and if you slipped that ring on
your finger, you were invisible; only in the full sunlight could you be seen,
and then only by your shadow, and that would be shaky and faint.</p>
<p>"My birthday-present! It came to me on my birthday, my precious."
So he had always said to himself. But who knows how Gollum came by that present,
ages ago in the old days when such rings were still at large in the world?
Perhaps even the Master who ruled them could not have said. Gollum used to wear
it at first, till it tired him; and then he kept it in a pouch next his skin,
till it galled him; and now usually he hid it in a hole in the rock on his
island, and was always going back to look at it. And still sometimes he put it
on, when he could not bear to be parted from it any longer, or when he was very,
very, hungry, and tired of fish. Then he would creep along dark passages looking
for stray goblins. He might even venture into places where the torches were lit
and made his eyes blink and smart; for he would be safe. Oh yes, quite safe. No
one would see him, no one would notice him, till he had his fingers on their
throat. Only a few hours ago he had worn it, and caught a small goblin-imp. How
it squeaked! He still had a bone or two left to gnaw, but he wanted something
softer.</p>
<p>"Quite safe, yes," he whispered to himself. "It won't see us,
will it, my precious? No. It won't see us, and its nassty little sword will be
useless, yes quite."</p>
<p>That is what was in his wicked little mind, as he slipped suddenly from
Bilbo's side, and flapped back to his boat, and went off into the dark. Bilbo
thought he had heard the last of him. Still he waited a while; for he had no
idea how to find his way out alone.</p>
<p>Suddenly he heard a screech. It sent a shiver down his back. Gollum was
cursing and wailing away in the gloom, not very far off by the sound of it. He
was on his island, scrabbling here and there, searching and seeking in vain.</p>
<p>"Where is it? Where iss it?" Bilbo heard him crying. "Losst it
is, my precious, lost, lost! Curse us and crush us, my precious is lost!"</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" Bilbo called. "What have you lost?"</p>
<p>"It mustn't ask us," shrieked Gollum. "Not its business, no,
gollum! It's losst, gollum, gollum, gollum."</p>
<p>"Well, so am I," cried Bilbo, "and I want to get unlost. And I
won the game, and you promised. So come along! Come and let me out, and then go
on with your looking!"</p>
<p>Utterly miserable as Gollum sounded, Bilbo could not find much pity in his
heart, and he had a feeling that anything Gollum wanted so much could hardly be
something good.</p>
<p>"Come along!" he shouted.</p>
<p>"No, not yet, precious!" Gollum answered. "We must search for
it, it's lost, gollum."</p>
<p>"But you never guessed my last question, and you promised," said
Bilbo.</p>
<p>"Never guessed!" said Gollum. Then suddenly out of the gloom came a
sharp hiss. "What has it got in its pocketses? Tell us that. It must tell
first."</p>
<p>As far as Bilbo knew, there was no particular reason why he should not tell.
Gollum's mind had jumped to a guess quicker than his; naturally, for Gollum had
brooded for ages on this one thing, and he was always afraid of its being
stolen. But Bilbo was annoyed at the delay. After all, he had won the game,
pretty fairly, at a horrible risk. "Answers were to be guessed not
given," he said.</p>
<p>"But it wasn't a fair question," said Gollum. "Not a riddle,
precious, no."</p>
<p>"Oh well, if it's a matter of ordinary questions," Bilbo replied,
"then I asked one first. What have you lost? Tell me that!"</p>
<p>"What has it got in its pocketses?" The sound came hissing louder
and sharper, and as he looked towards it, to his alarm Bilbo now saw two small
points of light peering at him. As suspicion grew in Gollum's mind, the light of
his eyes burned with a pale flame.</p>
<p>"What have you lost?" Bilbo persisted. But now the light in
Gollum's eyes had become a green fire, and it was coming swiftly nearer. Gollum
was in his boat again, paddling wildly back to the dark shore; and such a rage
of loss and suspicion was in his heart that no sword had any more terror for
him.</p>
<p>Bilbo could not guess what had maddened the wretched creature, but he saw
that all was up, and that Gollum meant to murder him at any rate. Just in time
he turned and ran blindly back up the dark passage down which he had come,
keeping close to the wall and feeling it with his left hand.</p>
<p>"What has it got in its pocketses?" he heard the hiss loud behind
him, and the splash as Gollum leapt from his boat.</p>
<p>"What have I, I wonder?" he said to himself, as he panted and
stumbled along. He put his left hand in his pocket. The ring felt very cold as
it quietly slipped on to his groping forefinger.</p>
<p>The hiss was close behind him. He turned now and saw Gollum's eyes like small
green lamps coming up the slope. Terrified he tried to run faster, but suddenly
he struck his toes on a snag in the floor, and fell flat with his little sword
under him.</p>
<p>In a moment Gollum was on him. But before Bilbo could do anything, recover
his breath, pick himself up, or wave his sword, Gollum passed by, taking no
notice of him, cursing and whispering as he ran.</p>
<p>What could it mean? Gollum could see in the dark. Bilbo could see the light
of his eyes palely shining even from behind. Painfully he got up, and sheathed
his sword, which was now glowing faintly again, then very cautiously he
followed. There seemed nothing else to do. It was no good crawling back down to
Gollum's water. Perhaps if he followed him, Gollum might lead him to some way of
escape without meaning to.</p>
<p>"Curse it! curse it! curse it!" hissed Gollum. "Curse the
Baggins! It's gone! What has it got in its pocketses? Oh we guess, we guess, my
precious. He's found it, yes he must have. My birthday-present."</p>
<p>Bilbo pricked up his ears. He was at last beginning to guess himself. He
hurried a little, getting as close as he dared behind Gollum, who was still
going quickly, not looking back, but turning his head from side to side, as
Bilbo could see from the faint glimmer on the walls.</p>
<p>"My birthday-present! Curse it! How did we lose it, my precious? Yes,
that's it. When we came this way last, when we twisted that nassty young
squeaker. That's it. Curse it! It slipped from us, after all these ages and
ages! It's gone, gollum."</p>
<p>Suddenly Gollum sat down and began to weep, a whistling and gurgling sound
horrible to listen to. Bilbo halted and flattened himself against the
tunnel-wall. After a while Gollum stopped weeping and began to talk. He seemed
to be having an argument with himself.</p>
<p>"It's no good going back there to search, no. We doesn't remember all
the places we've visited. And it's no use. The Baggins has got it in its
pocketses; the nassty noser has found it, we says."</p>
<p>"We guesses, precious, only guesses. We can't know till we find the
nassty creature and squeezes it. But it doesn't know what the present can do,
does it? It'll just keep it in its pocketses. It doesn't know, and it can't go
far. It's lost itself, the nassty nosey thing. It doesn't know the way out. It
said so."</p>
<p>"It said so, yes; but it's tricksy. It doesn't say what it means. It
won't say what it's got in its pocketses. It knows. It knows a way in, it must
know a way out, yes. It's off to the back-door. To the back-door, that's
it."</p>
<p>"The goblinses will catch it then. It can't get out that way,
precious."</p>
<p>"Ssss, sss, gollum! Goblinses! Yes, but if it's got the present, our
precious present, then goblinses will get it, gollum! They'll find it, they'll
find out what it does. We shan't ever be safe again, never, gollum! One of the
goblinses will put it on, and then no one will see him. He'll be there but not
seen. Not even our clever eyeses will notice him; and he'll come creepsy and
tricksy and catch us, gollum, gollum!"</p>
<p>"Then let's stop talking, precious, and make haste. If the Baggins has
gone that way, we must go quick and see. Go! Not far now. Make haste!"</p>
<p>With a spring Gollum got up and started shambling off at a great pace. Bilbo
hurried after him, still cautiously, though his chief fear now was of tripping
on another snag and falling with a noise. His head was in a whirl of hope and
wonder. It seemed that the ring he had was a magic ring: it made you invisible!
He had heard of such things, of course, in old old tales; but it was hard to
believe that he really had found one, by accident. Still there it was: Gollum
with his bright eyes had passed him by, only a yard to one side.</p>
<p>On they went, Gollum flip-flapping ahead, hissing and cursing; Bilbo behind
going as softly as a hobbit can. Soon they came to places where, as Bilbo had
noticed on the way down, side-passages opened, this way and that. Gollum began
at once to count them.</p>
<p>"One left, yes. One right, yes. Two right, yes, yes. Two left, yes,
yes." And so on and on.</p>
<p>As the count grew he slowed down, and he began to get shaky and weepy; for he
was leaving the water further and further behind, and he was getting afraid.
Goblins might be about, and he had lost his ring. At last he stopped by a low
opening, on their left as they went up.</p>
<p>"Seven right, yes. Six left, yes!" he whispered. "This is it.
This is the way to the back-door, yes. Here's the passage!"</p>
<p>He peered in, and shrank back. "But we durstn't go in, precious, no we
durstn't. Goblinses down there. Lots of goblinses. We smells them. Ssss!"</p>
<p>"What shall we do? Curse them and crush them! We must wait here,
precious, wait a bit and see."</p>
<p>So they came to a dead stop. Gollum had brought Bilbo to the way out after
all, but Bilbo could not get in! There was Gollum sitting humped up right in the
opening, and his eyes gleamed cold in his head, as he swayed it from side to
side between his knees.</p>
<p>Bilbo crept away from the wall more quietly than a mouse; but Gollum
stiffened at once, and sniffed, and his eyes went green. He hissed softly but
menacingly. He could not see the hobbit, but now he was on the alert, and he had
other senses that the darkness had sharpened: hearing and smell. He seemed to be
crouched right down with his flat hands splayed on the floor, and his head
thrust out, nose almost to the stone. Though he was only a black shadow in the
gleam of his own eyes, Bilbo could see or feel that he was tense as a bowstring,
gathered for a spring.</p>
<p>Bilbo almost stopped breathing, and went stiff himself. He was desperate. He
must get away, out of this horrible darkness, while he had any strength left. He
must fight. He must stab the foul thing, put its eyes out, kill it. It meant to
kill him. No, not a fair fight. He was invisible now. Gollum had no sword.
Gollum had not actually threatened to kill him, or tried to yet. And he was
miserable, alone, lost. A sudden understanding, a pity mixed with horror, welled
up in Bilbo's heart: a glimpse of endless unmarked days without light or hope of
betterment, hard stone, cold fish, sneaking and whispering. All these thoughts
passed in a flash of a second. He trembled. And then quite suddenly in another
flash, as if lifted by a new strength and resolve, he leaped.</p>
<p>No great leap for a man, but a leap in the dark. Straight over Gollum's head
he jumped, seven feet forward and three in the air; indeed, had he known it, he
only just missed cracking his skull on the low arch of the passage.</p>
<p>Gollum threw himself backwards, and grabbed as the hobbit flew over him, but
too late: his hands snapped on thin air, and Bilbo, falling fair on his sturdy
feet, sped off down the new tunnel. He did not turn to see what Gollum was
doing. There was a hissing and cursing almost at his heels at first, then it
stopped. All at once there came a bloodcurdling shriek, filled with hatred and
despair. Gollum was defeated. He dared go no further. He had lost: lost his
prey, and lost, too, the only thing he had ever cared for, his precious. The cry
brought Bilbo's heart to his mouth, but still he held on. Now faint as an echo,
but menacing, the voice came behind:</p>
<p>"Thief, thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it for
ever!"</p>
<p>Then there was a silence. But that too seemed menacing to Bilbo. "If
goblins are so near that he smelt them," he thought, "then they'll
have heard his shrieking and cursing. Careful now, or this way will lead you to
worse things."</p>
<p>The passage was low and roughly made. It was not too difficult for the
hobbit, except when, in spite of all care, he stubbed his poor toes again,
several times, on nasty jagged stones in the floor. "A bit low for goblins,
at least for the big ones," thought Bilbo, not knowing that even the big
ones, the ores of the mountains, go along at a great speed stooping low with
their hands almost on the ground.</p>
<p>Soon the passage that had been sloping down began to go up again, and after a
while it climbed steeply. That slowed Bilbo down. But at last the slope stopped,
the passage turned a corner, and dipped down again, and there, at the bottom of
a short incline, he saw, filtering round another corner-a glimpse of light. Not
red light, as of fire or lantern, but a pale out-of-doors sort of light. Then
Bilbo began to run.</p>
<p>Scuttling as fast as his legs would carry him he turned the last corner and
came suddenly right into an open space, where the light, after all that time in
the dark, seemed dazzlingly bright. Really it was only a leak of sunshine in
through a doorway, where a great door, a stone door, was left standing open.</p>
<p>Bilbo blinked, and then suddenly he saw the goblins: goblins in full armour
with drawn swords sitting just inside the door, and watching it with wide eyes,
and watching the passage that led to it. They were aroused, alert, ready for
anything.</p>
<p>They saw him sooner than he saw them. Yes, they saw him. Whether it was .an
accident, or a last trick of the ring before it took a new master, it was not on
his finger. With yells of delight the goblins rushed upon him.</p>
<p>A pang of fear and loss, like an echo of Gollum's misery, smote Bilbo, and
forgetting even to draw his sword he struck his hands into his pockets. And-
there was the ring still, in his left pocket, and it slipped on his finger. The
goblins stopped short. They could not see a sign of him. He had vanished. They
yelled twice as loud as before, but not so delightedly.</p>
<p>"Where is it?" they cried.</p>
<p>"Go back up the passage!" some shouted.</p>
<p>"This way!" some yelled. "That way!" others yelled.</p>
<p>"Look out for the door," bellowed the captain.</p>
<p>Whistles blew, armour clashed, swords rattled, goblins cursed and swore and
ran hither and thither, falling over one another and getting very angry. There
was a terrible outcry, to-do, and disturbance.</p>
<p>Bilbo was dreadfully frightened, but he had the sense to understand what had
happened and to sneak behind a big barrel which held drink for the
goblin-guards, and so get out of the way and avoid being bumped into, trampled
to death, or caught by feel.</p>
<p>"I must get to the door, I must get to the door!" he kept on saying
to himself, but it was a long time before he ventured to try. Then it was like a
horrible game of blind-man's buff. The place was full of goblins running about,
and the poor little hobbit dodged this way and that, was knocked over by a
goblin who could not make out what he had bumped into, scrambled away on all
fours, slipped between the legs of the captain just in time, got up, and ran for
the door.</p>
<p>It was still ajar, but a goblin had pushed it nearly to. Bilbo struggled but
he could not move it. He tried to squeeze through the crack. He squeezed and
squeezed, and he stuck! It was awful. His buttons had got wedged on the edge of
the door and the door-post. He could see outside into the open air: there were a
few steps running down into a narrow valley between tall mountains; the sun came
out from behind a cloud and shone bright on the outside of the door-but he could
not get through.</p>
<p>Suddenly one of the goblins inside shouted: "There is a shadow by the
door. Something is outside!"</p>
<p>Bilbo's heart jumped into his mouth. He gave a terrific squirm. Buttons burst
off in all directions. He was through, with a torn coat and waistcoat, leaping
down the steps like a goat, while bewildered goblins were still picking up his
nice brass buttons on the doorstep.</p>
<p>Of course they soon came down after him, hooting and hallooing, and hunting
among the trees. But they don't like the sun: it makes their legs wobble and
their heads giddy. They could not find Bilbo with the ring on, slipping in and
out of the shadow of the trees, running quick and quiet, and keeping out of the
sun; so soon they went back grumbling and cursing to guard the door. Bilbo had
escaped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="06"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<h2>Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire</h2>
<p>Bilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not know where he was. He had lost
hood, cloak, food, pony, his buttons and his friends. He wandered on and on,
till the sun began to sink westwards-behind the mountains. Their shadows fell
across Bilbo's path, and he looked back. Then he looked forward and could see
before him only ridges and slopes falling towards lowlands and plains glimpsed
occasionally between the trees.</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" he exclaimed. "I seem to have got right to the
other side of the Misty Mountains, right to the edge of the Land Beyond! Where
and O where can Gandalf and the dwarves have got to? I only hope to goodness
they are not still back there in the power of the goblins!"</p>
<p>He still wandered on, out of the little high valley, over its edge, and down
the slopes beyond; but all the while a very uncomfortable thought was growing
inside him. He wondered whether he ought not, now he had the magic ring, to go
back into the horrible, horrible, tunnels and look for his friends. He had just
made up his mind that it was his duty, that he must turn back-and very miserable
he felt about it-when he heard voices.</p>
<p>He stopped and listened. It did not sound like goblins; so he crept forward
carefully. He was on a stony path winding downwards with a rocky wall. on the
left hand; on the other side the ground sloped away and there were dells below
the level of the path overhung with bushes and low trees. In one of these dells
under the bushes people were talking.</p>
<p>He crept still nearer, and suddenly he saw peering between two big boulders a
head with a red hood on: it was Balin doing look-out. He could have clapped and
shouted for joy, but he did not. He had still got the ring on, for fear of
meeting something unexpected and unpleasant, and he saw that Balin was looking
straight at him without noticing him.</p>
<p>"I will give them all a surprise," he thought, as he crawled into
the bushes at the edge of the dell. Gandalf was arguing with the dwarves. They
were discussing all that had happened to them in the tunnels, and wondering and
debating what they were to do now. The dwarves were grumbling, and Gandalf was
saying that they could not possibly go on with their journey leaving Mr. Baggins
in the hands of the goblins, without trying to find out if he was alive or dead,
and without trying to rescue him.</p>
<p>"After all he is my friend," said the wizard, "and not a bad
little chap. I feel responsible for him. I wish to goodness you had not lost
him."</p>
<p>The dwarves wanted to know why he had ever been brought at all, why he could
not stick to his friends and come along with them, and why the wizard had not
chosen someone with more sense. "He has been more trouble than use so
far," said one. "If we have got to' go back now into those abominable
tunnels to look for him, then drat him, I say."</p>
<p>Gandalf answered angrily: "I brought him, and I don't bring things that
are of no use. Either you help me to look for him, or I go and leave you here to
get out of the mess as best you can yourselves. If we can only find him again,
you will thank me before all is over. Whatever did you want to go and drop him
for, Dori?"</p>
<p>"You would have dropped him," said Dori, "if a goblin had
suddenly grabbed your leg from behind in the dark, tripped up your feet, and
kicked you in the back!"</p>
<p>"Then why didn't you pick him up again?"</p>
<p>"Good heavens! Can you ask! Goblins fighting and biting in the dark,
everybody falling over bodies and hitting one another! You nearly chopped off my
head with Glamdring, and Thorin Was stabbing here there and everywhere with
Orcrist. All of a sudden you gave one of your blinding flashes, and we saw the
goblins running back yelping. You shouted 'follow me everybody!' and everybody
ought to have followed. We thought everybody had. There was no time to count, as
you know quite well, till we had dashed through the gate-guards, out of the
lower door, and helter-skelter down here. And here we are-without the burglar,
confusticate him!"</p>
<p>"And here's the burglar!" said Bilbo stepping down into the middle
of them, and slipping off the ring.</p>
<p>Bless me, how they jumped! Then they shouted with surprise and delight.
Gandalf was as astonished as any of them, but probably more pleased than all the
others. He called to Balin and told him what he thought of a look-out man who
let people walk right into them like that without warning. It is a fact that
Bilbo's reputation went up a very great deal with the dwarves after this. If
they had still doubted that he was really a first-class burglar, in spite of
Gandalf's words, they doubted no longer. Balin was the most puzzled of all; but
everyone said it was a very clever bit of work.</p>
<p>Indeed Bilbo was so pleased with their praise that he just chuckled inside
and said nothing whatever about the ring; and when they asked him how he did it,
he said: "O, just crept along, you know-very carefully and quietly."</p>
<p>"Well, it is the first time that even a mouse has crept along carefully
and quietly under my very nose and not been spotted," said Balin, "and
I take off my hood to you." Which he did.</p>
<p>"Balin at your service," said he.</p>
<p>"Your servant, Mr. Baggins," said Bilbo.</p>
<p>Then they wanted to know all about his adventures after they had lost him,
and he sat down and told them everything-except about the finding of the ring
("not just now" he thought). They were particularly interested in the
riddle-competition, and shuddered most appreciatively at his description of
Gollum.</p>
<p>"And then I couldn't think of any other question with him sitting beside
me," ended Bilbo; "so I said 'what's in my pocket?' And he couldn't
guess in three goes. So I said: 'what about your promise? Show me the way out!'
But he came at me to kill me, and I ran, and fell over, and he missed me in the
dark. Then I followed him, because I heard him talking to himself. He thought I
really knew the way out, and so he was making for it. And then he sat down in
the entrance, and I could not get by. So I jumped over him and escaped, and ran
down to the gate."</p>
<p>"What about guards?" they asked. "Weren't there any?"</p>
<p>"O yes! lots of them; but I dodged 'em. I got stuck in the door, which
was only open a crack, and I lost lots of buttons," he said sadly looking
at his torn clothes. "But I squeezed through all right-and here I am."</p>
<p>The dwarves looked at him with quite a new respect, when he talked about
dodging guards, jumping over Gollum, and squeezing through, as if it was not
very difficult or very alarming.</p>
<p>"What did I tell you?" said Gandalf laughing. "Mr. Baggins has
more about him than you guess." He gave Bilbo a queer look from under his
bushy eyebrows, as he said this, and the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the
part of his tale that he had left out.</p>
<p>Then he had questions of his own to ask, for if Gandalf had explained it all
by now to the dwarves, Bilbo had not heard it. He wanted to know how the wizard
had turned up again, and where they had all got to now.</p>
<p>The wizard, to tell the truth, never minded explaining his cleverness more
than once, so now he had told Bilbo that both he and Elrond had been well aware
of the presence of evil goblins in that part of the mountains. But their main
gate used to come out on a different pass, one more easy to travel by, so that
they often caught people benighted near their gates. Evidently people had given
up going that way, and the goblins must have opened their new entrance at the
top of the pass the dwarves had taken, quite recently, because it had been found
quite safe up to now.</p>
<p>"I must see if I can't find a more or less decent giant to block it up
again," said Gandalf, "or soon there will be no getting over the
mountains at all."</p>
<p>As soon as Gandalf had heard Bilbo's yell he realized what had happened. In
the flash which killed the goblins that were grabbing him he had nipped inside
the crack, just as it snapped to. He followed after the drivers and prisoners
right to the edge of the great hall, and there he sat down and worked up the
best magic he could in the shadows.</p>
<p>"A very ticklish business, it was," he said. "Touch and
go!"</p>
<p>But, of course, Gandalf had made a special study of bewitchments with fire
and lights (even the hobbit had never forgotten the magic fireworks at Old
Took's midsummer-eve parties, as you remember). The rest we all know - except
that Gandalf knew all about the back-door, as the goblins called the lower gate,
where Bilbo lost his buttons. As a matter of fact it was well known to anybody
who was acquainted with this part of the mountains; but it took a wizard to keep
his head in the tunnels and guide them in the right direction.</p>
<p>"They made that gate ages ago," he said, "partly for a way of
escape, if they needed one; partly as a way out into the lands beyond, where
they still come in the dark and do great damage. They guard it always and no one
has ever managed to block it up. They will guard it doubly after this," he
laughed.</p>
<p>All the others laughed too. After all they had lost a good deal, but they had
killed the Great Goblin and a great many others besides, and they had all
escaped, so they might be said to have had the best of it so far.</p>
<p>But the wizard called them to their senses. "We must be getting on at
once, now we are a little rested," he said. "They will be out after us
in hundreds when night comes on; and already shadows are lengthening. They can
smell our footsteps for hours and hours after we have passed. We must be miles
on before dusk. There will be a bit of moon, if it keeps fine, and that is
lucky. Not that they mind the moon much, but it will give us a little light to
steer by."</p>
<p>"O yes!" he said in answer to more questions from the hobbit.
"You lose track of time inside goblin-tunnels. Today's Thursday, and it was
Monday night or Tuesday morning that we were captured. We have gone miles and
miles, and come right down through the heart of the mountains, and are now on
the other side-quite a short cut. But we are not at the point to which our pass
would have brought us; we are too far to the North, and have some awkward
country ahead. And we are still pretty high up. Let's get on!"</p>
<p>"I am so dreadfully hungry," groaned Bilbo, who was suddenly aware
that he had not had a meal since the night before the night before last. Just
think of that for a hobbit! His stomach felt all empty and loose and his legs
all wobbly, now that the excitement was over.</p>
<p>"Can't help it," said Gandalf, "unless you like to go back and
ask the goblins nicely to let you have your pony back and your luggage."</p>
<p>"No thank you!" said Bilbo.</p>
<p>"Very well then, we must just tighten our belts and trudge on - or we
shall be made into supper, and that will be much worse than having none
ourselves."</p>
<p>As they went on Bilbo looked from side to side for something to eat; but the
blackberries were still only in flower, and of course there were no nuts, nor
even hawthorn-berries. He nibbled a bit of sorrel, and he drank from a small
mountain-stream that crossed the path, and he ate three wild strawberries that
he found on its bank, but it was not much good.</p>
<p>They still went on and on. The rough path disappeared. The bushes, and the
long grasses, between the boulders, the patches of rabbit-cropped turf, the
thyme and the sage and the marjoram, and the yellow rockroses all vanished, and
they found themselves at the top of a wide steep slope of fallen stones, the
remains of a landslide. When they began to go down this, rubbish and small
pebbles rolled away from their feet; soon larger bits of split stone went
clattering down and started other pieces below them slithering and rolling; then
lumps of rocks were disturbed and bounded off, crashing down with a dust and a
noise. Before long the whole slope above them and below them seemed on the move,
and they were sliding away, huddled all together, in a fearful confusion of
slipping, rattling, cracking slabs and stones.</p>
<p>It was the trees at the bottom that saved them. They slid into the edge of a
climbing wood of pines that here stood right up the mountain slope from the
deeper darker forests of the valleys below. Some caught hold of the trunks and
swung themselves into lower branches, some (like the little hobbit) got behind a
tree to shelter from the onslaught of the rocks. Soon the danger was over, the
slide had stopped, and the last faint crashes could be heard as the largest of
the disturbed stones went bounding and spinning among the bracken and the
pine-roots far below.</p>
<p>"Well! that has got us on a bit," said Gandalf; "and even
goblins tracking us will have a job to come down here quietly."</p>
<p>"I daresay," grumbled Bombur; "but they won't find it
difficult to send stones bouncing down on our heads." The dwarves (and
Bilbo) were feeling far from happy, and were rubbing their bruised and damaged
legs and feet.</p>
<p>"Nonsense! We are going to turn aside here out of the path of the slide.
We must be quick! Look at the light!" The sun had long gone behind the
mountains. Already the shadows were deepening about them, though far away
through the trees and over the black tops of those growing lower down they could
still see the evening lights on the plains beyond. They limped along now as fast
as they were able down the gentle slopes of a pine forest in a slanting path
leading steadily southwards. At times they were pushing through a sea of bracken
with tall fronds rising right above the hobbit's head; at times they were
marching along quiet as quiet over a floor of pine-needles; and all the while
the forest-gloom got heavier and the forest-silence deeper. There was no wind
that evening to bring even a sea-sighing into the branches of the trees.</p>
<p>"Must we go any further?" asked Bilbo, when it was so dark that he
could only just see Thorin's beard wagging beside him, and so quiet that he
could hear the dwarves' breathing like a loud noise. "My toes are all
bruised and bent, and my legs ache, and my stomach is wagging like an empty
sack."</p>
<p>"A bit further," said Gandalf.</p>
<p>After what seemed ages further they came suddenly to an opening where no
trees grew. The moon was up and was shining into the clearing. Somehow it struck
all of them as not at all a nice place, although there was nothing wrong to see.</p>
<p>All of a sudden they heard a howl away down hill, a long shuddering howl. It
was answered by another away to the right and a good deal nearer to them; then
by another not far away to the left. It was wolves howling at the moon, wolves
gathering together!</p>
<p>There were no wolves living near Mr. Baggins' hole at home, but he knew that
noise. He had had it described to him often enough in tales. One of his elder
cousins (on the Took side), who had been a great traveller, used to imitate it
to frighten him. To hear it out in the forest under the moon was too much for
Bilbo. Even magic rings are not much use against wolves - especially against the
evil packs that lived under the shadow of the goblin-infested mountains, over
the Edge of the Wild on the borders of the unknown. Wolves of that sort smell
keener than goblins, and do not need to see you to catch you!</p>
<p>"What shall we do, what shall we do!" he cried. "Escaping
goblins to be caught by wolves!" he said, and it became a proverb, though
we now say 'out of the frying-pan into the fire' in the same sort of
uncomfortable situations.</p>
<p>"Up the trees quick!" cried Gandalf; and they ran to the trees at
the edge of the glade, hunting for those that had branches fairly low, or were
slender enough to swarm up. They found them as quick as ever they could, you can
guess; and up they went as high as ever they could trust the branches. You would
have laughed (from a safe distance), if you had seen the dwarves sitting up in
the trees with their beards dangling down, like old gentlemen gone cracked and
playing at being boys. Fili and Kili were at the top of a tall larch like an
enormous Christmas tree. Dori, Nori, On, Oin, and Gloin were more comfortable in
a huge pine with regular branches sticking out at intervals like the spokes of a
wheel. Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and Thorin were in another. Dwalin and Balin had
swarmed up a tall slender fir with few branches and were trying to find a place
to sit in the greenery of the topmost boughs. Gandalf, who was a good deal
taller than the others, had found a tree into which they could not climb, a
large pine standing at the very edge of the glade. He was quite hidden in its
boughs, but you could see his eyes gleaming in the moon as he peeped out.</p>
<p>And Bilbo? He could not get into any tree, and was scuttling about from trunk
to trunk, like a rabbit that has lost its hole and has a dog after it.</p>
<p>"You've left the burglar behind again}" said Nori to Dori looking
down.</p>
<p>"I can't be always carrying burglars on my back," said Dori,
"down tunnels and up trees! What do you think I am? A porter?"</p>
<p>"He'll be eaten if we don't 'do something," said Thorin, for there
were howls all around them now, getting nearer and nearer. "Dori!" he
called, for Dori was lowest down in the easiest tree, "be quick, and give
Mr. Baggins a hand up!"</p>
<p>Dori was really a decent fellow in spite of his grumbling. Poor Bilbo could
not reach his hand even when he climbed down to the bottom branch and hung his
arm down as far as ever he could. So Dori actually climbed out of the tree and
let Bilbo scramble up and stand on his back.</p>
<p>Just at that moment the wolves trotted howling into the clearing. All of a
sudden there were hundreds of eyes looking at them. Still Dori did not let Bilbo
down. He waited till he had clambered off his shoulders into the branches, and
then he jumped for the branches himself. Only just in time! A wolf snapped- at
his cloak as he swung up, and nearly got him. In a minute there was a whole pack
of them yelping all round the tree and leaping up at the trunk, with eyes
blazing and tongues hanging out.</p>
<p>But even the wild Wargs (for so the evil wolves over the Edge of the Wild
were named) cannot climb trees. For a time they were safe. 'Luckily it was warm
and not windy. Trees are not very comfortable to sit in for long at any time;
but in the cold and the wind, with wolves all round below waiting for you, they
can be perfectly miserable places.</p>
<p>This glade in the ring of trees was evidently a meeting-place of the wolves.
More and more kept coming in. They left guards at the foot of the tree in which
Dori and Bilbo were, and then went sniffling about till they had smelt out every
tree that had anyone in it. These they guarded too, while all the rest (hundreds
and hundreds it seemed) went and sat in a great circle in the glade; and in the
middle of the circle was a great grey wolf. He spoke to them in the dreadful
language of the Wargs. Gandalf understood it. Bilbo did not, but it sounded
terrible to him, and as if all their talk was about cruel and wicked things, as
it was. Every now and then all the Wargs in the circle would answer their grey
chief all together, and their dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall out
of his pine-tree.</p>
<p>I will tell you what Gandalf heard, though Bilbo did not understand it. The
Wargs and the goblins often helped one another in wicked deeds. Goblins do not
usually venture very far from their mountains, unless they are driven out and
are looking for new homes, or are marching to war (which I am glad to say has
not happened for a long while). But in those days they sometimes used to go on
raids, especially to get food or slaves to work for them. Then they often got
the Wargs to help and shared the plunder with them. Sometimes they rode on
wolves like men do on horses. Now it seemed that a great goblin-raid had been
planned for that very night. The Wargs had come to meet the goblins and the
goblins were late. The reason, no doubt, was the death of the Great Goblin, and
all the excitement caused by the dwarves and Bilbo and the wizard, for whom they
were probably still hunting.</p>
<p>In spite of the dangers of this far land bold men had of late been making
their way back into it from the South, cutting down trees, and building
themselves places to live in among the more pleasant woods in the valleys and
along the river-shores. There were many of them, and they were brave and
well-armed, and even the Wargs dared not attack them if there were many
together, or in the bright day. But now they had planned with the goblins' help
to come by night upon some of the villages nearest the mountains. If their plan
had been carried out, there would have been none left there next day; all would
have been killed except the few the goblins kept from the wolves and carried
back as prisoners to their caves.</p>
<p>This was dreadful talk to listen to, not only because of the brave woodmen
and their wives and children, but also because of the danger which now
threatened Gandalf and his friends. The Wargs were angry and puzzled at finding
them here in their very meeting-place. They thought they were friends of the
woodmen, and were come to spy on them, and would take news of their plans down
into the valleys, and then the goblins and the wolves would have to fight a
terrible battle instead of capturing prisoners and devouring people waked
suddenly from their sleep. So the Wargs had no intention of going away and
letting the people up the trees escape, at any rate not until morning. And long
before that, they said, goblin soldiers would be coming down from the mountains;
and goblins can climb trees, or cut them down.</p>
<p>Now you can understand why Gandalf, listening to their growling and yelping,
began to be dreadfully afraid, wizard though he was, and to feel that they were
in a very bad place, and had not yet escaped at all. All the same he was not
going to let them have it all their own way, though he could not do very much
stuck up in a tall tree with wolves all round on the ground below. He gathered
the huge pinecones from the branches of his tree. Then he set one alight with
bright blue fire, and threw it whizzing down among the circle of the wolves. It
struck one on the back, and immediately his shaggy coat caught fire, and he was
leaping to and fro yelping horribly. Then another came and another, one in blue
flames, one in red, another in green. They burst on the ground in the middle of
the circle and went off in coloured sparks and smoke. A specially large one hit
the chief wolf on the nose, and he leaped in the air ten feet, and then rushed
round and round the circle biting and snapping even at the other wolves in his
anger and fright.</p>
<p>The dwarves and Bilbo shouted and cheered. The rage of the wolves was
terrible to see, and the commotion they made filled all the forest. Wolves are
afraid of fire at all times, but this was a most horrible and uncanny fire. If a
spark got in their coats it stuck and burned into them, and unless they rolled
over quick they were soon all in flames. Very soon all about the glade wolves
were rolling over and over to put out the sparks on their backs, while those
that were burning were running about howling and setting others alight, till
their own friends chased them away and they fled off down the slopes crying and
yammering and looking for water.</p>
<p>"What's all this uproar in the forest tonight?" said the Lord of
the Eagles. He was sitting, black in the moonlight, on the top of a lonely
pinnacle of rock at the eastern edge of the mountains. "I hear wolves'
voices! Are the goblins at mischief in the woods?"</p>
<p>He swept up into the air, and immediately two of his guards from the rocks at
either hand leaped up to follow him. They circled up in the sky and looked down
upon the ring of the Wargs, a tiny spot far far below. But eagles have keen eyes
and can see small things at a great distance. The lord of the eagles of the
Misty Mountains had eyes that could look at the sun unblinking, and could see a
rabbit moving on the ground a mile below even in the moonlight. So though he
could not see the people in the trees, he could make out the commotion among the
wolves and see the tiny flashes of fire, and hear the howling and yelping come
up faint from far beneath him. Also he could see the glint of the moon on goblin
spears and helmets, as long lines of the wicked folk crept down the hillsides
from their gate and wound into the wood.</p>
<p>Eagles are not kindly birds. Some are cowardly and cruel. But the ancient
race of the northern mountains were the greatest of all birds; they were proud
and strong and noble-hearted. They did not love goblins, or fear them. When they
took any notice of them at all (which was seldom, for they did not eat such
creatures ), they swooped on them and drove them shrieking back to their caves,
and stopped whatever wickedness they were doing. The goblins hated the eagles
and feared them, but could not reach their lofty seats, or drive them from the
mountains.</p>
<p>Tonight the Lord of the Eagles was filled with curiosity to know what was
afoot; so he summoned many other eagles to him, and they flew away from the
mountains, and slowly circling ever round and round they came down, down, down
towards the ring of the wolves and the meeting-place of the goblins.</p>
<p>A very good thing too! Dreadful things had been going on down there. The
wolves that had caught fire and fled into the forest had set it alight in
several places. It was high summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains
there had been little rain for some time. Yellowing bracken, fallen branches,
deep-piled pine-needles, and here and there dead trees, were soon in flames. All
round the clearing of the Wargs fire was leaping. But the wolf-guards did not
leave the trees. Maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the
trunks, and cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, with their tongues
hanging out, and their eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames.</p>
<p>Then suddenly goblins came running up yelling. They thought a battle with the
woodmen was going on; but they goon learned what had really happened. Some of
them actually sat down and laughed. Others waved their spears and clashed the
shafts against their shields. Goblins are not afraid of fire, and they soon had
a plan which seemed to them most amusing.</p>
<p>Some got all the wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern and brushwood
round the tree-trunks. Others rushed round and stamped and beat, and beat and
stamped, until nearly all the flames were put out-but they did not put out the
fire nearest to the trees where the dwarves were. That fire they fed with leaves
and dead branches and bracken. Soon they had a ring of smoke and flame all round
the dwarves, a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; but it closed
slowly in, till the running fire was licking the fuel piled under the trees.
Smoke was in Bilbo's eyes, he could feel the heat of the flames; and through the
reek he could see the goblins dancing round and round in a circle like people
round a midsummer bonfire. Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears and
axes stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting.</p>
<p>He could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fifteen birds in five firtrees,</p>
<p>their feathers were fanned in a fiery breeze!</p>
<p>But, funny little birds, they had no wings!</p>
<p>O what shall we do with the funny little things?</p>
<p>Roast 'em alive, or stew them in a pot;</p>
<p>fry them, boil them and eat them hot?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>Then they stopped and shouted out: "Fly away little birds! Fly away if
you can! Come down little birds, or you will get roasted in your nests! Sing,
sing little birds! Why don't you sing?"</p>
<p>"Go away! little boys!" shouted Gandalf in answer. "It isn't
bird-nesting time. Also naughty little boys that play with fire get
punished." He said it to make them angry, and to show them he was not
frightened of them-though of course he was, wizard though he was. But they took
no notice, and they went on singing.</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Burn, burn tree and fern!</p>
<p>Shrivel and scorch! A fizzling torch</p>
<p>To light the night for our delight,</p>
<p>Ya hey!</p>
<p>Bake and toast 'em, fry and roast 'em</p>
<p>till beards blaze, and eyes glaze;</p>
<p>till hair smells and skins crack,</p>
<p>fat melts, and bones black</p>
<p>in cinders lie</p>
<p>beneath the sky!</p>
<p>So dwarves shall die,</p>
<p>and light the night for our delight,</p>
<p>Ya hey!</p>
<p>Ya-harri-heyl</p>
<p>Ya hoy!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>And with that Ya hoy! the flames were under Gandalf’s tree. In a moment it
spread to the others. The bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked.</p>
<p>Then Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. The sudden splendour flashed
from his wand like lightning, as he got ready to spring down from on high right
among the spears of the goblins. That would have been the end of him, though he
would probably have killed many of them as he came hurtling down like a
thunderbolt. But he never leaped.</p>
<p>Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles swept down from above, seized him
in his talons, and was gone.</p>
<p>There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord
of the Eagles, to whom Gandalf had now spoken. Back swept the great birds that
were with him, and down they came like huge black shadows. The wolves yammered
and gnashed their teeth; the goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung
their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them swooped the eagles; the dark
rush of their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far away;
their talons tore at goblin faces. Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized
the dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as ever they dared to go.</p>
<p>Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind again! He just managed to catch
hold of Dori's legs, as Dori was borne off last of all; and they went together
above the tumult and the burning, Bilbo swinging in the air with his arms nearly
breaking.</p>
<p>Now far below the goblins and the wolves were scattering far and wide in the
woods. A few eagles were still circling and sweeping above the battle-ground.
The flames about the trees sprang suddenly up above the highest branches. They
went up in crackling fire. There was a sudden flurry of sparks and smoke. Bilbo
had escaped only just in time!</p>
<p>Soon the light of the burning was faint below, a red twinkle on the black
floor; and they were high up in the sky, rising all the time in strong sweeping
circles. Bilbo never forgot that flight, clinging onto Dori's ankles. He moaned
"my arms, my arms!"; but Dori groaned "my poor legs, my poor
legs!"</p>
<p>At the best of times heights made Bilbo giddy. He used to turn queer if he
looked over the edge of quite a little cliff; and he had never liked ladders,
let alone trees (never having had to escape from wolves before). So you can
imagine how his head swam now, when he looked down between his dangling toes and
saw the dark lands opening wide underneath him, touched here and there with the
light of the moon on a hill-side rock or a stream in the plains.</p>
<p>The pale peaks of the mountains were coming nearer, moonlit spikes of rock
sticking out of black shadows. Summer or not, it seemed very cold. He shut his
eyes and wondered if he could hold on any longer. Then he imagined what would
happen if he did not. He felt sick. The flight ended only just in time for him,
just before his arms gave way. He loosed Dori's ankles with a gasp and fell onto
the rough platform of an eagle's eyrie. There he lay without speaking, and his
thoughts were a mixture of surprise at being saved from the fire, and fear lest
he fell off that narrow place into the deep shadows on either side. He was
feeling very queer indeed in his head by this time after the dreadful adventures
of the last three days with next to nothing to eat, and he found himself saying
aloud: "Now I know what a piece of bacon feels like when it is suddenly
picked out of the pan on a fork and put back on the shelf!"</p>
<p>"No you don't!" be heard Dori answering, "because the bacon
knows that it will get back in the pan sooner or later; and it is to be hoped we
shan't. Also eagles aren't forks!"</p>
<p>"O no! Not a bit like storks-forks, I mean," said Bilbo sitting up
and looking anxiously at the eagle who was perched close by. He wondered what
other nonsense he had been saying, and if the eagle would think it rude. You
ought not to be rude to an eagle, when you are only the size of a hobbit, and
are up in his eyrie at night!</p>
<p>The eagle only sharpened his beak on a stone and trimmed his feathers and
took no notice.</p>
<p>Soon another eagle flew up. "The Lord of the Eagles bids you to bring
your prisoners to the Great Shelf," he cried and was off again. The other
seized Dori in his claws and flew away with him into the night leaving Bilbo all
alone. He had just strength to wonder what the messenger had meant by
'prisoners,' and to begin to think of being torn up for supper like a rabbit,
when his own turn came. The eagle came back, seized him in his talons by the
back of his coat, and swooped off. This time he flew only a short way. Very soon
Bilbo was laid down, trembling with fear, on a wide shelf of rock on the
mountain-side. There was no path down on to it save by flying; and no path down
off it except by jumping over a precipice. There he found all the others sitting
with their backs to the mountain wall. The Lord of the Eagles also was there and
was speaking to Gandalf.</p>
<p>It seemed that Bilbo was not going to be eaten after all. The wizard and the
eagle-lord appeared to know one another slightly, and even to be on friendly
terms. As a matter of fact Gandalf, who had often been in the mountains, had
once rendered a service to the eagles and healed their lord from an arrow-wound.
So you see 'prisoners' had meant 'prisoners rescued from the goblins' only, and
not captives of the eagles. As Bilbo listened to the talk of Gandalf he realized
that at last they were going to escape really and truly from the dreadful
mountains. He was discussing plans with the Great Eagle for carrying the dwarves
and himself and Bilbo far away and setting them down well on their journey
across the plains below.</p>
<p>The Lord of the Eagles would not take them anywhere near where men lived.
"They would shoot at us with their great bows of yew," he said,
"for they would think we were after their sheep. And at other times they
would be right. No! we are glad to cheat the goblins of their sport, and glad to
repay our thanks to you, but we will not risk ourselves for dwarves in the
southward plains."</p>
<p>"Very well," said Gandalf. "Take us where and as far as you
will! We are already deeply obliged to you. But in the meantime we are famished
with hunger."</p>
<p>"I am nearly dead of it," said Bilbo in a weak little voice that
nobody heard.</p>
<p>"That can perhaps be mended," said the Lord of the Eagles.</p>
<p>Later on you might have seen a bright fire on the shelf of rock and the
figures of the dwarves round it cooking and making a fine roasting smell. The
eagles had brought up dry boughs for fuel, and they had brought rabbits, hares,
and a small sheep. The dwarves managed all the preparations. Bilbo was too weak
to help, and anyway he was not much good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat,
being used to having it delivered by the butcher all ready to cook. Gandalf,
too, was lying down after doing his part in setting the fire going, since Oin
and Gloin had lost their tinder-boxes. (Dwarves have never taken to matches even
yet.)</p>
<p>So ended the adventures of the Misty Mountains. Soon Bilbo's stomach was
feeling full and comfortable again, and he felt he could sleep contentedly,
though really he would have liked a loaf and butter better than bits of meat
toasted on sticks. He slept curled up on the hard rock more soundly than ever he
had done on his feather-bed in his own little hole at home. But all night he
dreamed of his own house and wandered in his sleep into all his different rooms
looking for something that he could not find nor remember what it looked like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="07"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<h2>Queer Lodgings</h2>
<p>The next morning Bilbo woke up with the early sun in his eyes. He jumped up
to look at the time and to go and put his kettle on-and found he was not home at
all. So he sat down and wished in vain for a wash and a brush. He did not get
either, nor tea nor toast nor bacon for his breakfast, only cold mutton and
rabbit. And after that he had to get ready for a fresh start.</p>
<p>This time he was allowed to climb on to an eagle's back and cling between his
wings. The air rushed over him and he shut his eyes. The dwarves were crying
farewells and promising to repay the lord of the eagles if ever they could, as
off rose fifteen great birds from the mountain's side. The sun was still close
to the eastern edge of things. The morning was cool, and mists were in the
valleys and hollows and twined here and there about the peaks and pinnacles of
the hills. Bilbo opened an eye to peep and saw that the birds were already high
up and the world was far away, and the mountains were falling back behind them
into the distance. He shut his eyes again and held on tighter.</p>
<p>"Don't pinch!" said his eagle. "You need not be frightened
like a rabbit, even if you look rather like one. It is a fair morning with
little wind. What is finer than flying?"</p>
<p>Bilbo would have liked to say: "A warm bath and late breakfast on the
lawn afterwards;" but he thought it better to say nothing at all, and to
let go his clutch just a tiny bit.</p>
<p>After a good while the eagles must have seen the point they were making for,
'even from their great height, for they began to go down circling round in great
spirals. They did this for a long while, and at last the hobbit opened his eyes
again. The earth was much nearer, and below them were trees that looked like
oaks and elms, and wide grass lands, and a river running through it all. But
cropping out of the ground, right in the path of the stream which looped itself
about it, was a great rock, almost a hill of stone, like a last outpost of the
distant mountains, or a huge piece cast miles into the plain by some giant among
giants.</p>
<p>Quickly now to the top of this rock the eagles swooped one by one and set
down their passengers.</p>
<p>"Farewell!" they cried, "wherever you fare, till your eyries
receive you at the journey's end!" That is the polite thing to say among
eagles.</p>
<p>"May the wind under your wings bear you where the sun sails and the moon
walks," answered Gandalf, who knew the correct reply.</p>
<p>And so they parted. And though the lord of the eagles became in after days
the King of All Birds and wore a golden crown, and his fifteen chieftains golden
collars (made of the gold that the dwarves gave them), Bilbo never saw them
again-except high and far off in the battle of Five Armies. But as that comes in
at the end of this tale we will say no more about it just now.</p>
<p>There was a flat space on the top of the hill of stone and a well worn path
with many steps leading down it to the river, across which a ford of huge flat
stones led to the grass-land beyond the stream. There was a little cave (a
wholesome one with a pebbly floor) at the foot of the steps and near the end of
the stony ford. Here the party gathered and discussed what was to be done.</p>
<p>"I always meant to see you all safe (if possible) over the
mountains," said the wizard, "and now by good management and good luck
I have done it. Indeed we are now a good deal further east than I ever meant to
come with you, for after all this is not my adventure. I may look in on it again
before it is all over, but in the meanwhile I have some other pressing business
to attend to."</p>
<p>The dwarves groaned and looked most distressed, and Bilbo wept. They had
begun to think Gandalf was going in come all the way and would always be there
to help them out of difficulties. "I am not going to disappear this very
instant," said he. "I can give you a day or two more. Probably I can
help you out of your present plight, and I need a little help myself. We have no
food, and no baggage, and no ponies to ride; and you don't know where you are.
Now I can tell you that. You are still some miles north of the path which we
should have been following, if we had not left the mountain pass in a hurry.
Very few people live in these parts, unless they have come here since I was last
down this way, which is some years ago. But there is somebody that I know of,
who lives not far away. That Somebody made the steps on the great rock-the Carrock I believe he calls it. He does not come
here often, certainly not in the daytime, and it is no good waiting for him. In
fact it would be very dangerous. We must go and find him; and if all goes well
at our meeting, I think I shall be off and wish you like the eagles 'farewell
wherever you fare!' "</p>
<p>They begged him not to leave them. They offered him dragon-gold and silver
and jewels, but he would not change his mind.</p>
<p>"We shall see, we shall see!" he said, "and I think I have
earned already some of your dragon-gold - when you have got it."</p>
<p>After that they stopped pleading. Then they took off their clothes and bathed
in the river, which was shallow and clear and stony at the ford. When they had
dried in the sun, which was now strong and warm, they were refreshed, if still
sore and a little hungry. Soon they crossed the ford (carrying the hobbit), and
then began to march through the long green grass and down the lines of the
wide-armed oaks and the tall elms.</p>
<p>"And why is it called the Carrock?" asked Bilbo as he went along at
the wizard's side.</p>
<p>"He called it the Carrock, because carrock is his word for it. He calls
things like that carrocks, and this one is the Carrock because it is the only
one near his home and he knows it well."</p>
<p>"Who calls it? Who knows it?"</p>
<p>"The Somebody I spoke of-a very great person. You must all be very
polite when I introduce you. I shall introduce you slowly, two by two, I think;
and you must be careful not to annoy him, or heaven knows what will happen. He
can be appalling when he is angry, though he is kind enough if humoured. Still I
warn you he gets angry easily."</p>
<p>The dwarves all gathered round when they heard the wizard talking like this
to Bilbo. "Is that the person you are taking us to now?" they asked.
"Couldn't you find someone more easy-tempered? Hadn't you better explain it
all a bit clearer?"-and so on.</p>
<p>"Yes it certainly is! No I could not! And I was explaining very
carefully," answered the wizard crossly. "If you must know more, his
name is Beorn. He is very strong, and he is a skin-changer."</p>
<p>"What! a furrier, a man that calls rabbits conies, when he doesn't turn
their skins into squirrels?" asked Bilbo.</p>
<p>"Good gracious heavens, no, no, NO, NO!" said Gandalf. "Don't
be a fool Mr. Baggins if you can help it; and in the name of all wonder don't
mention the word furrier again as long as you are within a hundred miles of his
house, nor, rug, cape, tippet, muff, nor any other such unfortunate word! He is
a skin-changer. He changes his skin; sometimes he is a huge black bear,
sometimes he is a great strong black-haired man with huge arms and a great
beard. I cannot tell you much more, though that ought to be enough. Some say
that he is a bear descended from the great and ancient bears of the mountains
that lived there before the giants came. Others say that he is a man descended
from the first men who lived before Smaug or the other dragons came into this
part of the world, and before the goblins came into the hills out of the North.
I cannot say, though I fancy the last is the true tale. He is not the sort of
person to ask questions of.</p>
<p>"At any rate he is under no enchantment but his own. He lives in an
oak-wood and has a great wooden house; and as a man he keeps cattle and horses
which are nearly is marvellous as himself. They work for him and talk to him. He
does not eat them; neither does he hunt or eat wild animals. He keeps hives and
hives of great fierce bees, and lives most on cream and honey. As a bear he
ranges far and wide. I once saw him sitting all alone on the top of the Carrock
at night watching the moon sinking towards the Misty Mountains, and I heard him
growl in the tongue of bears; 'The day will come when they will perish and I
shall go back!' That is why I believe he once came from the mountains
himself."</p>
<p>Bilbo and the dwarves had now plenty to think about, and they asked no more
questions. They still had a long way to walk before them. Up slope and down dale
they plodded. It grew very hot. Sometimes they rested under the trees, and then
Bilbo felt so hungry that he would have eaten acorns, if any had been ripe
enough yet to have fallen to the ground.</p>
<p>It was the middle of the afternoon before they noticed that great patches of
flowers had begun to spring up, all the same kinds growing together as if they
had been planted. Especially there was clover, waving patches of cockscomb
clover, and purple clover, and wide stretches of short white sweet
honey-smelling clover. There was a buzzing and a whirring and a droning in the
air. Bees were busy everywhere. And such bees! Bilbo had never seen anything
like them.</p>
<p>"If one was to sting me," he thought, "I should swell up as
big again as I am!"</p>
<p>They were bigger than hornets. The drones were bigger than your thumb, a good
deal, and the bands of yellow on their deep black bodies shone like fiery gold.</p>
<p>"We are getting near," said Gandalf. "We are on the edge of
his bee-pastures."</p>
<p>After a while they came to a belt of tall and very ancient oaks, and beyond
these to a high thorn-hedge through which you could neither see nor scramble.</p>
<p>"You had better wait here," said the wizard to the dwarves;
"and when I call or whistle begin to come after me - you will see the way I
go-but only in pairs, mind, about five minutes between each pair of you. Bombur
is fattest and will do for two, he had better come alone and last. Come on Mr.
Baggins! There is a gate somewhere round this way." And with that he went
off along the hedge taking the frightened hobbit with him.</p>
<p>They soon came to a wooden gate, high and broad, beyond which they could see
gardens and a cluster of low wooden buildings, some thatched and made of
unshaped logs; barns, stables, sheds, and a long low wooden house.</p>
<p>Inside on the southward side of the great hedge were rows and rows of hives
with bell-shaped tops made of straw. The noise of the giant bees flying to and
fro and crawling in and out filled all the air.</p>
<p>The wizard and the hobbit pushed open the heavy creaking gate and went down a
wide track towards the house. Some horses, very sleek and well-groomed, trotted
up across the grass and looked at them intently with very intelligent faces;
then off they galloped to the buildings.</p>
<p>"They have gone to tell him of the arrival of strangers," said
Gandalf.</p>
<p>Soon they reached a courtyard, three walls of which were formed by the wooden
house and its two long wings. In the middle there was lying a great oak-trunk
with many lopped branches beside it. Standing near was a huge man with a thick
black beard and' hair, and great bare arms and legs with knotted muscles. He was
clothed in a tunic of wool down to his knees, and was leaning on a large axe.</p>
<p>The horses were standing by him with their noses at his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Ugh! here they are!" he said to the horses. "They don't look
dangerous. You can be off!" He laughed a great rolling laugh, put down his
axe and came forward.</p>
<p>"Who are you and what do you want?" he asked gruffly, standing in
front of them and towering tall above Gandalf.</p>
<p>As for Bilbo he could easily have trotted through his legs without ducking
his head to miss the fringe of the man's brown tunic.</p>
<p>"I am Gandalf," said the wizard.</p>
<p>"Never heard of him," growled the man, "And what's this little
fellow?" he said, stooping down to frown at the hobbit with his bushy
eyebrows.</p>
<p>"That is Mr. Baggins, a hobbit of good family and unimpeachable
reputation," said Gandalf. Bilbo bowed. He had no hat to take off, and was
painfully conscious of his many missing buttons. "I am a wizard,"
continued Gandalf. "I have heard of you, if you have not heard of me; but
perhaps you have heard of my good cousin Radagast who lives near the Southern
borders of Mirkwood?"</p>
<p>"Yes; not a bad fellow as wizards go, I believe. I used to see him now
and again," said Beorn. "Well, now I know who you are, or who you say
you are. What do you want?"</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth, we have lost our luggage and nearly lost our
way, and are rather in need of help, or at least advice. I may say we have had
rather a bad time with goblins in the mountains."</p>
<p>"Goblins?" said the big man less gruffly. "O ho, so you've
been having trouble with them have you? What did you go near them for?"</p>
<p>"We did not mean to. They surprised us at night in a pass which we had
to cross, we were coming out of the Lands over West into these countries-it is a
long tale."</p>
<p>"Then you had better come inside and tell me some of it, if it won't
take all day," said the man leading the way through a dark door that opened
out of the courtyard into the house.</p>
<p>Following him they found themselves in a wide hall with a fire-place in the
middle. Though it was summer there was a wood-fire burning and the smoke was
rising to the blackened rafters in search of the way out through an opening in
the roof. They passed through this dim hall, lit only by the fire and the hole
above it, and came through another smaller door into a sort of veranda propped
on wooden posts made of single tree-trunks. It faced south and was still warm
and filled with the light of the westering sun which slanted into it, and fell
golden on the garden full of flowers that came right up to the steps.</p>
<p>Here they sat on wooden benches while Gandalf began his tale, and Bilbo swung
his dangling legs and looked at the flowers in the garden, wondering what their
names could be, as he had never seen half of them before.</p>
<p>"I was coming over the mountains with a friend or two…" said the
wizard.</p>
<p>"Or two? I can only see one, and a little one at that," said Beorn.</p>
<p>"Well to tell you the truth, I did not like to bother you with a lot of
us, until I found out if you were busy. I will give a call, if I may."</p>
<p>"Go on, call away!"</p>
<p>So Gandalf gave a long shrill whistle, and presently Thorin and Dori came
round the house by the garden path and stood bowing low before them.</p>
<p>"One or three you meant, I see!" said Beorn. "But these aren't
hobbits, they are dwarves!"</p>
<p>"Thorin Oakenshield, at your service! Dori at your service!" said
the two dwarves bowing again.</p>
<p>"I don't need your service, thank you," said Beorn, "but I
expect you need mine. I am not over fond of dwarves; but if it is true you are
Thorin (son of Thrain, son of Thror, I believe), and that your companion is
respectable, and that you are enemies of goblins and are not up to any mischief
in my lands-what are you up to, by the way?"</p>
<p>"They are on their way to visit the land of their fathers, away east
beyond Mirkwood," put in Gandalf, "and it is entirely an accident that
we are in your lands at all. We were crossing by the High Pass that should have
brought us to the road that lies to the south of your country, when we were
attacked by the evil goblins­-as I was about to tell you."</p>
<p>"Go on telling, then!" said Beorn, who was never very polite.</p>
<p>"There was a terrible storm; the stone-giants were out hurling rocks,
and at the head of the pass we took refuge in a cave, the hob bit and I and
several of our companions…"</p>
<p>"Do you call two several?"</p>
<p>"Well, no. As a matter of fact there were more than two."</p>
<p>"Where are they? Killed, eaten, gone home?"</p>
<p>"Well, no. They don't seem all to have come when I whistled. Shy, I
expect. You see, we are very much afraid that we are rather a lot for you to
entertain."</p>
<p>"Go on, whistle again! I am in for a party, it seems, and one or two
more won't make much difference," growled Beorn.</p>
<p>Gandalf whistled again; but Nori and Ori were there almost before he had
stopped, for, if you remember, Gandalf had told them to come in pairs every five
minutes.</p>
<p>"Hullo!" said Beorn. "You came pretty quick-where were you
hiding? Come on my jack-in-the-boxes!"</p>
<p>"Nori at your service, Ori at . . ." they began; but Beorn
interrupted them.</p>
<p>"Thank you! When I want your help I will ask for it. Sit down, and let's
get on with this tale, or it will be supper-time before it is ended."</p>
<p>"As soon as we were asleep," went on Gandalf, "a crack at the
back of the cave opened; goblins came out and grabbed the hobbit and the dwarves
and our troop of ponies-"</p>
<p>"Troop of ponies? What were you-a travelling circus? Or were you
carrying lots of goods? Or do you always call six a troop?"</p>
<p>"O no! As a matter of fact there were more than six ponies, for there
were more than six of us-and well, here are two more!" Just at that moment
Balin and Dwalin appeared and bowed so low that their beards swept the stone
floor. The big man was frowning at first, but they did their very best to be
frightfully polite, and kept on nodding and bending and bowing and waving their
hoods before their knees (in proper dwarf-fashion), till he stopped frowning and
burst into a chuckling laugh; they looked so comical.</p>
<p>"Troop, was right," he said. "A fine comic one. Come in my
merry men, and what are your names? I don't want your service just now, only
your names; and then sit down and stop wagging!"</p>
<p>"Balin and Dwalin," they said not daring to be offended, and sat
flop on the floor looking rather surprised.</p>
<p>"Now go on again!" said Beorn to the wizard.</p>
<p>"Where was 1? O yes- I was not grabbed. I killed a goblin or two with a
flash-"</p>
<p>"Good!" growled Beorn. "It is some good being a wizard,
then."</p>
<p>"-and slipped inside the crack before it closed. I followed down into
the main hall, which was crowded with goblins. The Great Goblin was there with
thirty or forty armed guards. I thought to myself 'even if they were not all
chained together, what can a dozen do against so many?' "</p>
<p>"A dozen! That's the first time I've heard eight called a dozen. Or have
you still got some more jacks that haven't yet come out of their boxes?"</p>
<p>"Well, yes, there seem to be a couple more here now - Fili and Kili, I
believe," said Gandalf, as these two now appeared and stood smiling and
bowing.</p>
<p>"That's enough!" said Beorn. "Sit down and be quiet! Now go
on, Gandalf!"</p>
<p>So Gandalf went on with the tale, until he came to the fight in the dark, the
discovery of the lower gate, and their horror when they found that Mr. Baggins
had been mislaid.</p>
<p>"We counted ourselves and found that there was no hobbit. There were
only fourteen of us left!"</p>
<p>"Fourteen! That's the first time I've heard one from ten leave fourteen.
You mean nine, or else you haven't told me yet all the names of your
party."</p>
<p>"Well, of course you haven't seen Oin and Gloin yet. And, bless me! here
they are. I hope you will forgive them for bothering you."</p>
<p>"O let 'em all come! Hurry up! Come along, you two, and sit down! But
look here, Gandalf, even now we have only got yourself and ten dwarves and the
hobbit that was lost. That only makes eleven (plus one mislaid) and not
fourteen, unless wizards count differently to other people. But now please get
on with the tale." Beorn did not show it more than he could help, but
really he had begun to get very interested. You see, in the old days he had
known the very part of the mountains that Gandalf was describing. He nodded and
he growled, when he heard of the hobbit's reappearance and of their scramble
down the stone-slide and of the wolf-ring m the woods. When Gandalf came to
their climbing into trees with the wolves all underneath, he got up and strode
about and muttered:</p>
<p>"I wish I had been there! I would have given them more than
fireworks!"</p>
<p>"Well," said Gandalf very glad to see that his tale was making a
good impression, "I did the best I could. There we were with the wolves
going mad underneath us and the forest beginning to blaze in places, when the
goblins came down from the hills and discovered us. They yelled with delight and
sang songs making fun of us. Fifteen birds in five fir-trees…"</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" growled Beorn. "Don't pretend that goblins
can't count. They can. Twelve isn't fifteen and they know it."</p>
<p>"And so do 1. There were Bifur and Bofur as well. I haven't ventured to
introduce them before, but here they are."</p>
<p>In came Bifur and Bofur. "And me!" gasped Bombur pulling up behind.
He was fat, and also angry at being left till last. He refused to wait five
minutes, and followed immediately after the other two.</p>
<p>"Well, now there are fifteen of you; and since goblins can count, I
suppose that is all that there were up the trees. Now perhaps we can finish this
story without any more interruptions." Mr. Baggins saw then how clever
Gandalf had been. The interruptions had really made Beorn more interested in the
story, and the story had kept him from sending the dwarves off at once like
suspicious beggars. He never invited people into his house, if he could help it.
He had very few friends and they lived a good way away; and he never invited
more than a couple of these to his house at a time. Now he had got fifteen
strangers sitting in his porch!</p>
<p>By the time the wizard had finished his tale and had told of the eagles'
rescue and of how they had all been brought to the Carrock, the sun had fallen
behind the peaks of the Misty Mountains and the shadows were long in Beorn's
garden.</p>
<p>"A very good tale!" said he. "The best I have heard for a long
while. If all beggars could tell such a good one, they might find me kinder. You
may be making it all up, of course, but you deserve a supper for the story all
the same. Let's have something to eat!"</p>
<p>"Yes, please!" they all said together. "Thank you very
much!"</p>
<p>Inside the hall it was now quite dark. Beorn clapped his hands, and in
trotted four beautiful white ponies and several large long-bodied grey dogs.
Beorn said something to them in a queer language like animal noises turned into
talk. They went out again and soon came back carrying torches in their mouths,
which they lit at the fire and stuck in low brackets on the pillars of the hall
about the central hearth.</p>
<p>The dogs could stand on their hind-legs when they wished, and carry things
with their fore-feet. Quickly they got out boards and trestles from the side
walls and set them up near the fire.</p>
<p>Then baa-baa-baa! was heard, and in came some snow-white sheep led by a large
coal-black ram. One bore a white cloth embroidered at the edges with figures of
animals; others bore on their broad backs trays with bowls and platters and
knives and wooden spoons, which the dogs took and quickly laid on the trestle
tables. These were very low, low enough even for Bilbo to sit at comfortably.
Beside them a pony pushed two low-seated benches with wide rush-bottoms and
little short thick legs for Gandalf and Thorin, while at the far end he put
Beorn's big black chair of the same sort (in which he sat with his great legs
stuck far out under the table). These were all the chairs he had in his hall,
and he probably had them low like the tables for the convenience of the
wonderful animals that waited on him. What did the rest sit on? They were not
forgotten. The other ponies came in rolling round drum-shaped sections of logs,
smoothed and polished, and low enough even for Bilbo; so soon they were all
seated at Beorn's table, and the hall had not seen such a gathering for many a
year.</p>
<p>There they had a supper, or a dinner, such as they had not had since they
left the Last Homely House in the West and said good-bye to Elrond. The light of
the torches and the fire flickered about them, and on the table were two tall
red beeswax candles. All the time they ate, Beorn in his deep rolling voice told
tales of the wild lands on this side of the mountains, and especially of the
dark and dangerous wood, that lay outstretched far to North and South a day's
ride before them, barring their way to the East, the terrible forest of
Mirkwood.</p>
<p>The dwarves listened and shook their beards, for they knew that they must
soon venture into that forest and that after the mountains it was the worst of
the perils they had to pass before they came to the dragon's stronghold. When
dinner was over they began to tell tales of their own, but Beorn seemed to be
growing drowsy and paid little heed to them. They spoke most of gold and silver
and jewels and the making of things by smith-craft, and Beorn did not appear to
care for such things: there were no things of gold or silver in his hall, and
few save the knives were made of metal at all.</p>
<p>They sat long at the table with their wooden drinking-bowls filled with mead.
The dark night came on outside. The fires in the middle of the hall were built
with fresh logs and the torches were put out, and still they sat in the light of
the dancing flames with the pillars of the house standing tall behind them, arid
dark at the top like trees of the forest. Whether it was magic or not, it seemed
to Bilbo that he heard a sound like wind in the branches stirring in the
rafters, and the hoot of owls. Soon he began to nod with sleep and the voices
seemed to grow far away, until he woke with a start.</p>
<p>The great door had creaked and slammed. Beorn was gone. The dwarves were
sitting cross-legged on the floor round the fire, and presently they began to
sing. Some of the verses were like this, but there were many more, and their
singing went on for a long while:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The wind was on the withered heath,</p>
<p>but in the forest stirred no leaf:</p>
<p>there shadows lay by night and day,</p>
<p>and dark things silent crept beneath.</p>
<p>The wind came down from mountains cold,</p>
<p>and like a tide it roared and rolled;</p>
<p>the branches groaned, the forest moaned,</p>
<p>and leaves were laid upon the mould.</p>
<p>The wind went on from West to East ;</p>
<p>all movement in the forest ceased,</p>
<p>but shrill and harsh across the marsh</p>
<p>its whistling voices were released.</p>
<p>The grasses hissed, their tassels bent,</p>
<p>the reeds were rattling-on it went</p>
<p>o' er shaken pool under heavens cool</p>
<p>where racing clouds were torn and rent.</p>
<p>It passed the lonely Mountain bare</p>
<p>and swept above the dragon's lair :</p>
<p>there black and dark lay boulders stark</p>
<p>and flying smoke was in the air.</p>
<p>It left the world and took its flight</p>
<p>over the wide seas of the night.</p>
<p>The moon set sail upon the gale,</p>
<p>and stars were fanned to leaping light.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>Bilbo began to nod again. Suddenly up stood Gandalf. "It is time for us
to sleep," be said, "-for us, but not I think for Beorn. In this hall
we can rest sound and safe, but I warn you all not to forget what Beorn said
before he left us: you must not stray outside until the sun is up, on your
peril."</p>
<p>Bilbo found that beds had already been laid at the side of the hall, on a
sort of raised platform between the pillars and the outer wall. For him there
was a little mattress of straw and woollen blankets. He snuggled into them very
gladly, summertime though it was. The fire burned low and he fell asleep. Yet in
the night he woke: the fire had now sunk to a few embers; the dwarves and
Gandalf were all asleep, to judge by their breathing; a splash of white on the
floor came from the high moon, which was peering down through the smoke-hole in
the roof.</p>
<p>There was a growling sound outside, and a noise as of some great animal
scuffling at the door. Bilbo .wondered what it was, and whether it could be
Beorn in enchanted shape, and if he would come in as a bear and kill them.</p>
<p>He dived under the blankets and hid his head, and fell asleep again at last
in spite of his fears.</p>
<p>It was full morning when he awoke. One of the dwarves had fallen over him in
the shadows where he lay, and had rolled down with a bump from the platform on
to the floor. It was Bofur, and he was grumbling about it, when Bilbo opened his
eyes.</p>
<p>"Get up lazybones," he said, "or there will be no breakfast
left for you."</p>
<p>Up jumped Bilbo. "Breakfast!" he cried. "Where is
breakfast?"</p>
<p>"Mostly inside us," answered the other dwarves who were moving
around the hall; "but what is left is out on the veranda. We have been
about looking for Beorn ever since the sun got up; but there is no sign of him
anywhere, though we found breakfast laid as soon as we went out."</p>
<p>"Where is Gandalf?" asked Bilbo, moving off to find something to
eat as quick as he could.</p>
<p>"O! out and about somewhere," they told him. But he saw no sign of
the wizard all that day until the evening. Just before sunset he walked into the
hall, where the hobbit and the dwarves were having supper, waited on by Beorn's
wonderful animals, as they had been all day. Of Beorn they had seen and heard
nothing since the night before, and they were getting puzzled.</p>
<p>"Where is our host, and where have you been all day yourself?" they
all cried.</p>
<p>"One question at a time-and none till after supper! I haven't had a bite
since breakfast."</p>
<p>At last Gandalf pushed away his plate and jug - he had eaten two whole loaves
(with masses of butter and honey and clotted cream) and drunk at least a quart
of mead and he took out his pipe. "I will answer the second question
first," he said, "-but bless me! this is a splendid place for smoke
rings!" Indeed for a long time they could get nothing more out of him, he
was so busy sending smoke-rings dodging round the pillars of the hall, changing
them into all sorts of different shapes and colours, and setting them at last
chasing one another out of the hole in the roof.</p>
<p>They must have looked very queer from outside, popping out into the air one
after another, green, blue, red, silver-grey, yellow, white; big ones, little
ones; little ones dodging through big ones and joining into figure-eights, and
going off like a flock of birds into the distance.</p>
<p>"I have been picking out bear-tracks," he said at last. "There
must have been a regular bears' meeting outside here last night. I soon saw that
Beorn could not have made them all: there were far too many of them, and they
were of various sizes too. I should say there were little bears, large bears,
ordinary bears, and gigantic big bears, all dancing outside from dark to nearly
dawn. They came from almost every direction, except from the west over the
river, from the Mountains. In that direction only one set of footprints led-none
coming, only ones going away from here.</p>
<p>I followed these as far as the Carrock. There they disappeared into the
river, but the water was too deep and strong beyond the rock for me to cross. It
is easy enough, as you remember, to get from this bank to the Carrock by the
ford, but on the other side is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel. I
had to walk miles before I found a place where the river was wide and shallow
enough for me to wade and swim, and then miles back again to pick up the tracks
again. By that time it was too late for me to follow them far. They went
straight off in the direction of the pine-woods on the east side of the Misty
Mountains, where we had our pleasant little party with the Wargs the night
before last. And now I think I have answered your first question, too,"
ended Gandalf, and he sat a long while silent.</p>
<p>Bilbo thought he knew what the wizard meant. "What shall we do," he
cried, "if he leads all the Wargs and the goblins down here? We shall all
be caught and killed! I thought you said he was not 9 friend of theirs."</p>
<p>"So I did. And don't be silly! You had better go to bed, your wits are
sleepy."</p>
<p>The hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there seemed nothing else to do he did
go to bed; and while the dwarves were still singing songs he dropped asleep,
still puzzling his little head about Beorn, till he dreamed a dream of hundreds
of black bears dancing slow heavy dances round and round in the moonlight in the
courtyard. Then he woke up when everyone else was asleep, and he heard the same
scraping, scuffling, snuffling, and growling as before. Next morning they were
all wakened by Beorn himself.</p>
<p>"So here you all are still!" he said. He picked up the hobbit and
laughed: "Not eaten up by Wargs or goblins or wicked bears yet I see";
and he poked Mr. Baggins' waistcoat most disrespectfully. "Little bunny is
getting nice and fat again on bread and honey," he chuckled. "Come and
have some more!"</p>
<p>So they all went to breakfast with him. Beorn was most jolly for a change;
indeed he seemed to be in a splendidly good humour and set them all laughing
with his funny stories; nor did they have to wonder long where he had been or
why he was so nice to them, for he told them himself. He had been over the river
and right back up into the mountains-from which you can guess that he could
travel quickly, in bear's shape at any rate. From the burnt wolf-glade he had
soon found out that part of their story was true; but he had found more than
that: he had caught a Warg and a goblin wandering in the woods. From these he
had got news: the goblin patrols were still hunting with Wargs for the dwarves,
and they were fiercely angry because of the death of the Great Goblin, and also
because of the burning of the chief wolf's nose and the death from the wizard's
fire of many of his chief servants. So much they told him when he forced them,
but he guessed there was more wickedness than this afoot, and that a great raid
of the whole goblin army with their wolf-allies into the lands shadowed by the
mountains might soon be made to find the dwarves, or to take vengeance on the
men and creatures that lived there, and who they thought must be sheltering
them.</p>
<p>"It was a good story, that of yours," said Beorn, "but I like
it still better now I am sure it is true. You must forgive my not taking your
word. If you lived near the edge of Mirkwood, you would take the word of no one
that you did not know as well as your brother or better. As it is, I can only
say that I have hurried home as fast as I could to see that you were safe, and
to offer you any help that I can. I shall think more kindly of dwarves after
this. Killed the Great Goblin, killed the Great Goblin!" he chuckled
fiercely to himself.</p>
<p>"What did you do with the goblin and the Warg?" asked Bilbo
suddenly.</p>
<p>"Come and see!" said Beorn, and they followed round the house. A
goblin's head was stuck outside the gate and a warg-skin was nailed to a tree
just beyond. Beorn was a fierce enemy. But now he was their friend, and Gandalf
thought it wise to tell him their whole story and the reason of their journey,
so that they could get the most help he could offer.</p>
<p>This is what he promised to do for them. He would provide ponies for each of
them, and a horse for Gandalf, for their journey to the forest, and he would
lade them with food to last them for weeks with care, and packed so as to be as
easy as possible to carry-nuts, flour, sealed jars of dried fruits, and red
earthenware pots of honey, and twice-baked cakes that would keep good a long
time, and on a little of which they could march far. The making of these was one
of his secrets; but honey was in them, as in most of his foods, and they were
good to eat, though they made one thirsty. Water, he said, they would not need
to carry this side of the forest, for there were streams and springs along the
road. "But your way through Mirkwood is dark, dangerous and
difficult," he said. "Water is not easy to find there, nor food. The
time is not yet come for nuts (though it may be past and gone indeed before you
get to the other side), and nuts are about all that grows there fit for food; in
there the wild things are dark, queer, and savage. I will provide you with skins
for carrying water, and I will give you some bows and arrows. But I doubt very
much whether anything you find in Mirkwood will be wholesome to eat or to drink.
There is one stream there, I know, black and strong which crosses the path. That
you should neither drink of, nor bathe in; for I have heard that it carries
enchantment and a great drowsiness and forgetfulness. And in the dim shadows of
that place I don't think you will shoot anything, wholesome or unwholesome,
without straying from the path. That you MUST NOT do, for any reason. "That
is all the advice I can give you. Beyond the edge of the forest I cannot help
you much; you must depend on your luck and your courage and the food I send with
you. At the gate of the forest I must ask you to send back my horse and my
ponies. But I wish you all speed, and my house is open to you, if ever you come
back this way again."</p>
<p>They thanked him, of course, with many bows and sweepings of their hoods and
with many an "at your service, O master of the wide wooden halls!" But
their spirits sank at his grave words, and they all felt that the adventure was
far more dangerous than they had thought, while all the time, even if they
passed all the perils of the road, the dragon was waiting at the end.</p>
<p>All that morning they were busy with preparations. Soon after midday they ate
with Beorn for the last time, and after the meal they mounted the steeds he was
lending them, and bidding him many farewells they rode off through his gate at a
good pace.</p>
<p>As soon as they left his high hedges at the east of his fenced lands they
turned north and then bore to the north-west. By his advice they were no longer
making for the main forest-road to the south of his land. Had they followed the
pass, their path would have led them down the stream from the mountains that
joined the great river miles south of the Carrock. At that point there was a
deep ford which they might have passed, if they had still had their ponies, and
beyond that a track led to the skirts of the wood and to the entrance of the old
forest road. But Beorn had warned them that that way was now often used by the
goblins, while the forest-road itself, he bad heard, was overgrown and disused
at the eastern end and led to impassable marshes where the paths had long been
lost. Its eastern opening had also always been far to the south of the Lonely
Mountain, and would have left them still with a long and difficult northward
march when they got to the other side.</p>
<p>North of the Carrock the edge of Mirkwood drew closer to the borders of the
Great River, and though here the Mountains too drew down nearer, Beorn advised
them to take this way; for at a place a few days' ride due north of the Carrock
was the gate of a little-known pathway through Mirkwood that led almost straight
towards the Lonely Mountain.</p>
<p>"The goblins," Beorn had said, "will not dare to cross the
Great River for a hundred miles north of the Carrock nor to come near my house -
it is well protected at night!- but I should ride fast; for if they make their
raid soon they will cross the river to the south and scour all the edge of the
forest so as to cut you off, and Wargs run swifter than ponies. Still you are
safer going north, even though you seem to be going back nearer to their
strongholds; for that is what they will least expect, and they will have the
longer ride to catch you. Be off now as quick as you may!"</p>
<p>That is why they were now riding in silence, galloping wherever the ground
was grassy and smooth, with the mountains dark on their left, and in the
distance the line of the river with its trees drawing ever closer. The sun had
only just turned west when they started, and till evening it lay golden on the
land about them. It was difficult to think of pursuing goblins behind, and when
they had put many miles between them and Beorn's house they began to talk and to
sing again and to forget the dark forest-path that lay in front. But in the
evening when the dusk came on and the peaks of the mountains glowered against
the sunset they made a camp and set a guard, and most of them slept uneasily
with dreams in which there came the howl of hunting wolves and the cries of
goblins. Still the next morning dawned bright and fair again.</p>
<p>There was an autumn-like mist white upon the ground and the air was chill,
but soon the sun rose red in the East and the mists vanished, and while the
shadows were still long they were off again. So they rode now for two more days,
and all the while they saw nothing save grass and flowers and birds and
scattered trees, and occasionally small herds of red deer browsing or sitting at
noon in the shade. Sometimes Bilbo saw the horns of the harts sticking up out of
the long grass, and at first he thought they were the dead branches of trees.
That third evening they were so eager to press on, for Beorn had said that they
should reach the forest-gate early on the fourth day, that they rode still
forward after dusk and into the night beneath the moon. As the light faded Bilbo
thought he saw away to the right, or to the left, the shadowy form of a great
bear prowling along in the same direction. But if he dared to mention it to
Gandalf, the wizard only said: "Hush! Take no notice!"</p>
<p>Next day they started before dawn, though their night had been short. As soon
as it was light they could see the forest coming as it were to meet them, or
waiting for them like a black and frowning wall before them. The land began to
slope up and up, and it seemed to the hobbit that a silence began to draw in
upon them. Birds began to sing less. There were no more deer; not even rabbits
were to be seen. By the afternoon they had reached the eaves of Mirkwood, and
were resting almost beneath the great overhanging boughs of its outer trees.
Their trunks were huge and gnarled, their branches twisted, their leaves were
dark and long. Ivy grew on them and trailed along the ground.</p>
<p>"Well, here is Mirkwood!" said Gandalf. "The greatest of the
forests of the Northern world. I hope you like the look of it. Now you must send
back these excellent ponies you have borrowed."</p>
<p>The dwarves were inclined to grumble at this, but the wizard told them they
were fools. "Beorn is not as far off as you seem to think, and you had
better keep your promises anyway, for he is a bad enemy. Mr. Baggins' eyes are
sharper than yours, if you have not seen each night after dark a great bear
going along with us or sitting far of in the moon watching our camps. Not only
to guard you and guide you, but to keep an eye on the ponies too. Beorn may be
your friend, but he loves his animals as his children. You do not guess what
kindness he has shown you in letting dwarves ride them so far and so fast, nor
what would happen to you, if you tried to take them into the forest."</p>
<p>"What about the horse, then?" said Thorin. "You don't mention
sending that back."</p>
<p>"I don't, because I am not sending it."</p>
<p>"What about your promise then?"</p>
<p>"I will look after that. I am not sending the horse back, I am riding
it!"</p>
<p>Then they knew that Gandalf was going to leave them at the very edge of
Mirkwood, and they were in despair.</p>
<p>But nothing they could say would change his mind.</p>
<p>"Now we had this all out before, when we landed on the Carrock," he
said. "It is no use arguing. I have, as I told you, some pressing business
away south; and I am already late through bothering with you people. We may meet
again before all is over, and then again of course we may not. That depends on
your luck and on your courage and sense; and I am sending Mr. Baggins with you.
I have told you before that he has more about him than you guess, and you will
find that out before long. So cheer up Bilbo and don't look so glum. Cheer up
Thorin and Company! This is your expedition after all. Think of the treasure at
the end, and forget the forest and the dragon, at any rate until tomorrow
morning!"</p>
<p>When tomorrow morning came he still said the same.</p>
<p>So now there was nothing left to do but to fill their water-skins at a clear
spring they found close to the forest-gate, and unpack the ponies. They
distributed the packages as fairly as they could, though Bilbo thought his lot
was wearisomely heavy, and did not at all like the idea of trudging for miles
and miles with all that on his back.</p>
<p>"Don't you worry!" said Thorin. "It will get lighter all too
soon. Before long I expect we shall all wish our packs heavier, when the food
begins to run short."</p>
<p>Then at last they said good-bye to their ponies and turned their heads for
home. Off they trotted gaily, seeming very glad to put their tails towards the
shadow of Mirkwood. As they went away Bilbo could have sworn that a thing like a
bear left the shadow of the trees and shambled off quickly after them.</p>
<p>Now Gandalf too said farewell. Bilbo sat on the ground feeling very unhappy
and wishing he was beside the wizard on his tall horse. He had gone just inside
the forest after breakfast (a very poor one), and it had seemed as dark in there
in the morning as at night, and very secret: "a sort of watching and
waiting feeling," he said to himself.</p>
<p>"Good-bye!" said Gandalf to Thorin. "And good-bye to you all,
good-bye! Straight through the forest is your way now. Don't stray off the
track!-if you do, it is a thousand to one you will never find it again and never
get out of Mirkwood; and then I don't suppose I, or any one else, will ever see
you again."</p>
<p>"Do we really have to go through?" groaned the hobbit.</p>
<p>"Yes, you do!" said the wizard, "if you want to get to the
other side. You must either go through or give up your quest. And I am not going
to allow you to back out now, Mr. Baggins. I am ashamed of you for thinking of
it. You have got to look after all these dwarves for me," he laughed.</p>
<p>"No! no!" said Bilbo. "I didn't mean that. I meant, is there
no way round?"</p>
<p>"There is, if you care to go two hundred miles or so out of your way
north, and twice that south. But you wouldn't get a safe path even then. There
are no safe paths in this part of the world. Remember you are over the Edge of
the Wild now, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go. Before you could get
round Mirkwood in the North you would be right among the slopes of the Grey
Mountains, and they are simply stiff with goblins, hobgoblins, and rest of the
worst description. Before you could get round it in the South, you would get
into the land of the Necromancer; and even you. Bilbo, won't need me to tell you
tales of that black sorcerer. I don't advise you to go anywhere near the places
overlooked by his dark tower! Stick to the forest-track, keep your spirits up,
hope for the best, and with a tremendous slice of luck you may come out one day
and see the Long Marshes lying below you, and beyond them, high in the East, the
Lonely Mountain where dear old Smaug lives, though I hope he is not expecting
you."</p>
<p>"Very comforting you are to be sure," growled Thorin.
"Good-bye! If you won't come with us, you had better get off without any
more talk!"</p>
<p>"Good-bye then, and really good-bye!" said Gandalf, and he turned
his horse and rode down into the West. But he could not resist the temptation to
have the last word. Before he had passed quite out of hearing he turned and put
his hands to his mouth and called to them. They heard his voice come faintly:
"Good-bye! Be good, take care of yourselves-and DON'T LEAVE THE PATH!"</p>
<p>Then he galloped away and was soon lost to sight. "O good-bye and go
away!" grunted the dwarves, all the more angry because they were really
filled with dismay at losing him. Now began the most dangerous part of all the
journey.</p>
<p>They each shouldered the heavy pack and the water-skin which was their share,
and turned from the light that lay on the lands outside and plunged into the
forest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="08"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<h2>Flies and Spiders</h2>
<p>They walked in single file. The entrance to the path was like a sort of arch
leading into a gloomy tunnel made by two great trees that leant together, too
old and strangled with ivy and hung with lichen to bear more than a few
blackened leaves. The path itself was narrow and wound in and out among the
trunks. Soon the light at the gate was like a little bright hole far behind, and
the quiet was so deep that their feet seemed to thump along while all the trees
leaned over them and listened. As theft eyes became used to the dimness they
could see a little way to either side in a sort of darkened green glimmer.
Occasionally a slender beam of sun that had the luck to slip in through some
opening in the leaves far above, and still more luck in not being caught in the
tangled boughs and matted twigs beneath, stabbed down thin and bright before
them. But this was seldom, and it soon ceased altogether.</p>
<p>There were black squirrels in the wood. As Bilbo's sharp inquisitive eyes got
used to seeing things he could catch glimpses of them whisking off the path and
scuttling behind tree-trunks. There were queer noises too, grunts, scufflings,
and hurryings in the undergrowth, and among the leaves that lay piled endlessly
thick in places on the forest-floor; but what made the noises he could not see.
The nastiest things they saw were the cobwebs: dark dense cobwebs with threads
extraordinarily thick, often stretched from tree to tree, or tangled in the
lower branches on either side of them. There were none stretched across the
path, but whether because some magic kept it clear, or for what other reason
they could not guess.</p>
<p>It was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as they had
hated the tunnels of the goblins, and it seemed to offer even less hope of any
ending. But they had to go on and on, long after they were sick for a sight of
the sun and of the sky, and longed for the feel of wind on their faces. There
was no movement of air down under the forest-roof, and it was everlastingly
still and dark and stuffy. Even the dwarves felt it, who were used to
tunnelling, and lived at times for long whiles without the light of the sun; but
the hobbit, who liked holes to make a house in but not to spend summer days in,
felt he was being slowly suffocated.</p>
<p>The nights were the worst. It then became pitch-dark - not what you call
pitch-dark, but really pitch; so black that you really could see nothing. Bilbo
tried flapping his hand in front of his nose, but he could not see it at all.
Well, perhaps it is not true to say that they could see nothing: they could see
eyes. They slept all closely huddled together, and took it in turns to watch;
and when it was Bilbo's turn he would see gleams in the darkness round them, and
sometimes pairs of yellow or red or green eyes would stare at him from a little
distance, and then slowly fade and disappear and slowly shine out again in
another place. And sometimes they would gleam down from the branches just above
him; and that was most terrifying. But the eyes that he liked the least were
horrible pale bulbous sort of eyes. "Insect eyes" he thought,
"not animal eyes, only they are much too big."</p>
<p>Although it was not yet very cold, they tried lighting watch-fires at night,
but they soon gave that up. It seemed to bring hundreds and hundreds of eyes all
round them, though the creatures, whatever they were, were careful never to let
their bodies show in the little flicker of the flames. Worse still it brought
thousands of dark-grey and black moths, some nearly as big as your hand,
flapping and whirring round their ears. They could not stand that, nor the huge
bats, black as a top-hat, either; so they gave up fires and sat at night and
dozed in the enormous uncanny darkness.</p>
<p>All this went on for what seemed to the hobbit ages upon ages; and he was
always hungry, for they were extremely careful with their provisions. Even so,
as days followed days, and still the forest seemed just the same, they began to
get anxious. The food would not last for ever: it was in fact already beginning
to get low. They tried shooting at the squirrels, and they wasted many arrows
before they managed to bring one down on the path. But when they roasted it, it
proved horrible to taste, and they shot no more squirrels.</p>
<p>They were thirsty too, for they had none too much water, and in all the time
they had seen neither spring nor stream. This was their state when one day they
found their path blocked by a running water. It flowed fast and strong but not
very wide right across the way, and it was black, or looked it in the gloom. It
was well that Beorn had warned them against it, or they would have drunk from
it, whatever its colour, and filled some of their emptied skins at its bank. As
it was they only thought of how to cross it without wetting themselves in its
water. There had been a bridge of wood across, but it had rotted and fallen
leaving only the broken posts near the bank.</p>
<p>Bilbo kneeling on the brink and peering forward cried: "There is a boat
against the far bank! Now why couldn't it have been this side!"</p>
<p>"How far away do you think it is?" asked Thorin, for by now they
knew Bilbo had the sharpest eyes among them.</p>
<p>"Not at all far. I shouldn't think above twelve yards."</p>
<p>"Twelve yards! I should have thought it was thirty at least, but my eyes
don't see as well as they used a hundred years ago. Still twelve yards is as
good as a mile. We can't jump it, and we daren't try to wade or swim."</p>
<p>"Can any of you throw a rope?"</p>
<p>"What's the good of that? The boat is sure to be tied up, even if we
could hook it, which I doubt."</p>
<p>"I don't believe it is tied," said Bilbo, "though of course I
can't be sure in this light; but it looks to me as if it was just drawn up on
the bank, which is low just there where the path goes down into the water."</p>
<p>"Dori is the strongest, but Fili is the youngest and still has the best
sight," said Thorin. "Come here Fili, and see if you can see the boat
Mr. Baggins is talking about."</p>
<p>Fili thought he could; so when he had stared a long while to get an idea of
the direction, the others brought him a rope. They had several with them, and on
the end of the longest they fastened one of the large iron hooks they had used
for catching their packs to the straps about their shoulders. Fili took this in
his hand, balanced it for a moment, and then flung it across the stream.</p>
<p>Splash it fell in the water! "Not far enough!" said Bilbo who was
peering forward. "A couple of feet and you would have dropped it on to the
boat. Try again. I don't suppose the magic is strong enough to hurt you, if you
just touch a bit of wet rope."</p>
<p>Fili picked up the hook when he had drawn it back, rather doubtfully all the
same. This time he threw it with greater strength.</p>
<p>"Steady!" said Bilbo, "you have thrown it right into the wood
on the other side now. Draw it back gently." Fili hauled the rope back
slowly, and after a while Bilbo said:</p>
<p>"Carefully! It is lying on the boat; let's hope the hook will
catch."</p>
<p>It did. The rope went taut, and Fili pulled in vain. Kili came to his help,
and then Oin and Gloin. They tugged and tugged, and suddenly they all fell over
on their backs. Bilbo was on the lockout, however, caught the rope, and with a
piece of stick fended off the little black boat as it came rushing across the
stream. "Help!" he shouted, and Balin was just in time to seize the
boat before it floated off down the current.</p>
<p>"It was tied after all," said he, looking at the snapped painter
that was still dangling from it. "That was a good pull, my lads; and a good
job that our rope was the stronger."</p>
<p>"Who'll cross first?" asked Bilbo.</p>
<p>"I shall," said Thorin, "and you will come with me, and Fili
and Balin. That's as many as the boat will hold at a time. After that Kili and
Oin and Gloin and Don; next On and Nori, Bifur and Bofur; and last Dwalin and
Bombur."</p>
<p>"I'm always last and I don't like it," said Bombur. "It's
somebody else's turn today."</p>
<p>"You should not be so fat. As you are, you must be with the last and
lightest boatload. Don't start grumbling against orders, or something bad will
happen to you."</p>
<p>"There aren't any oars. How are you going to push the boat back to the
far bank?" asked the hobbit.</p>
<p>"Give me another length of rope and another hook," said Fili, and
when they had got it ready, he cast into the darkness ahead and as high as he
could throw it. Since it did not fall down again, they saw that it must have
stuck in the branches. "Get in now," said Fili, "and one of you
haul on the rope that is stuck in a tree on the other side. One of the others
must keep hold of the hook we used at first, and when we are safe on the other
side he can hook it on, and you can draw the boat back."</p>
<p>In this way they were all soon on the far bank safe across the enchanted
stream. Dwalin had just scrambled out with the coiled rope on his arm, and
Bombur (still grumbling) was getting ready to follow, when something bad did
happen. There was a flying sound of hooves on the path ahead. Out of the gloom
came suddenly the shape of a flying deer. It charged into the dwarves and bowled
them over, then gathered itself for a leap. High it sprang and cleared the water
with a mighty jump. But it did not reach the other side in safety. Thorin was
the only one who had kept his feet and his wits. As soon as they had landed he
had bent his bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden guardian of the boat
appeared. Now he sent a swift and sure shot into the leaping beast. As it
reached the further bank it stumbled. The shadows swallowed it up, but they
heard the sound of hooves quickly falter and then go still.</p>
<p>Before they could shout in praise of the shot, however, a dreadful wail from
Bilbo put all thoughts of venison out of their minds. "Bombur has fallen
in! Bombur is drowning!" he cried. It was only too true. Bombur had only
one foot on the land when the hart bore down on him, and sprang over him. He had
stumbled, thrusting the boat away from the bank, and then toppled back into the
dark water, his hands slipping off the slimy roots at the edge, while the boat
span slowly off and disappeared.</p>
<p>They could still see his hood above the water when they ran to the bank.
Quickly they flung a rope with a hook towards him. His hand caught it, and they
pulled him to the shore. He was drenched from hair to boots, of course, but that
was not the worst. When they laid him on the bank he was already fast asleep,
with one hand clutching the rope so tight that they could not get it from his
grasp; and fast asleep he remained in spite of all they could do. They were
still standing over him, cursing their ill luck, and Bombur's clumsiness, and
lamenting the loss of the boat which made it impossible for them to go back and
look for the hart, when they became aware of the dim blowing of horns in the
wood and the sound as of dogs baying far off. Then they all fell silent; and as
they sat it seemed they could hear the noise of a great hunt going by to the
north of the path, though they saw no sign of it. There they sat for a long
while and did not dare to make a move. Bombur slept on with a smile on his fat
face, as if he no longer cared for all the troubles that vexed them.</p>
<p>Suddenly on the path ahead appeared some white deer, a hind and fawns as
snowy white as the hart had been dark. They glimmered in the shadows. Before
Thorin could cry out three of the dwarves had leaped to their feet and loosed
off arrows from their bows. None seemed to find their mark. The deer turned and
vanished in the trees as silently as they had come, and in vain the dwarves shot
their arrows after them.</p>
<p>"Stop! stop!" shouted Thorin; but it was too late, the excited
dwarves had wasted their last arrows, and now the bows that Beorn had given them
were useless.</p>
<p>They were a gloomy party that night, and the gloom gathered still deeper on
them in the following days. They had crossed the enchanted stream; but beyond it
the path seemed to straggle on just as before, and in the forest they could see
no change. Yet if they had known more about it and considered the meaning of the
hunt and the white deer that had appeared upon their path, they would have known
that they were at last drawing towards the eastern edge, and would soon have
come, if they could have kept up their courage and their hope, to thinner trees
and places where the sunlight came again.</p>
<p>But they did not know this, and they were burdened with the heavy body of
Bombur, which they had to carry along with them as best they could, taking the
wearisome task in turns of four each while the others shared their packs. If
these had not become all too light in the last few days, they would never have
managed it; but a slumbering and smiling Bombur was a poor exchange for packs
filled with food however heavy. In a few days a time came when there was
practically nothing left to eat or to drink. Nothing wholesome could they see
growing in the woods, only funguses and herbs with pale leaves and unpleasant
smell.</p>
<p>About four days from the enchanted stream they came to a part where most of
the trees were beeches. They were at first inclined to be cheered by the change,
for here there was no undergrowth and the shadow was not so deep. There was a
greenish light about them, and in places they could see some distance to either
side of the path. Yet the light only showed them endless lines of straight grey
trunks like the pillars of some huge twilight hall. There was a breath of air
and a noise of wind, but it had a sad sound. A few leaves came rustling down to
remind them that outside autumn was coming on. Their feet ruffled among the dead
leaves of countless other autumns that drifted over the banks of the path from
the deep red carpets of the forest.</p>
<p>Still Bombur slept and they grew very weary. At times they heard disquieting
laughter. Sometimes there was singing in the distance too. The laughter was the
laughter of fair voices not of goblins, and the singing was beautiful, but it
sounded eerie and strange, and they were not comforted, rather they hurried on
from those parts with what strength they had left.</p>
<p>Two days later they found their path going downwards and before long they
were in a valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth of oaks.</p>
<p>"Is there no end to this accursed forest?" said Thorin.</p>
<p>"Somebody must climb a tree and see if he can get his head above the
roof and have a look round. The only way is to choose the tallest tree that
overhangs the path."</p>
<p>Of course "somebody" meant Bilbo. They chose him because to be of
any use the climber must get his head above the topmost leaves, and so he must
be light enough for the highest and slenderest branches to bear him. Poor Mr.
Baggins had never had much practice in climbing trees, but they hoisted him up
into the lowest branches of an enormous oak that grew right out into the path,
and up he had to go as best he could. He pushed his way through the tangled
twigs with many a slap in the eye; he was greened and grimed from the old bark
of the greater boughs; more than once he slipped and caught himself just in
time; and at last, after a dreadful struggle in a difficult place where there
seemed to be no convenient branches at all, he got near the top. All the time he
was wondering whether there were spiders in the tree, and how he was going to
get down again (except by falling).</p>
<p>In the end he poked his head above the roof of leaves, and then he found
spiders all right. But they were only small ones of ordinary size, and they were
after the butterflies. Bilbo's eyes were nearly blinded by the light. He could
hear the dwarves shouting up at him from far below, but he could not answer,
only hold on and blink. The sun was shining brilliantly, and it was a long while
before he could bear it. When he could, he saw all round him a sea of dark
green, ruffled here and there by the breeze; and there were everywhere hundreds
of butterflies. I expect they were a kind of 'purple emperor,' a butterfly that
loves the tops of oak-woods, but these were not purple at all, they were a dark
dark velvety black without any markings to be seen.</p>
<p>He looked at the 'black emperors' for a long time, and enjoyed the feel of
the breeze in his hair and on his face; but at length the cries of the dwarves,
who were now simply stamping with impatience down below, reminded him of his
real business. It was no good. Gaze as much as he might, he could see no end to
the trees and the leaves in any direction. His heart, that had been lightened by
the sight of the sun and the feel of the wind, sank back into his toes: there
was no food to go back to down below.</p>
<p>Actually, as I have told you, they were not far off the edge of the forest;
and if Bilbo had had the sense to see it, the tree that he had climbed, though
it was tall in itself, was standing near the bottom of a wide valley, so that
from its top the trees seemed to swell up all round like the edges of a great
bowl, and he could not expect to see how far the forest lasted. Still he did not
see this, and he climbed down full of despair. He got to the bottom again at
last scratched, hot, and miserable, and he could not see anything in the gloom
below when he got there. His report soon made the others as miserable as he was.</p>
<p>"The forest goes on for ever and ever and ever in all directions!
Whatever shall we do? And what is the use of sending a hobbit!" they cried,
as if it was his fault. They did not care tuppence about the butterflies, and
were only made more angry when he told them of the beautiful breeze, which they
were too heavy to climb up and feel.</p>
<p>That night they ate their very last scraps and crumbs of food; and next
morning when they woke the first thing they noticed was that they were still
gnawingly hungry, and the next thing was that it was raining and that here and
there the drip of it was dropping heavily on the forest floor. That only
reminded them that they were also parchingly thirsty, without doing anything to
relieve them: you cannot quench a terrible thirst by standing under giant oaks
and waiting for a chance drip to fall on your tongue. The only scrap of comfort
there was, came unexpectedly from Bombur.</p>
<p>He woke up suddenly and sat up scratching his head. He could not make out
where he was at all, nor why he felt so hungry; for he had forgotten everything
that had happened since they started their journey that May morning long ago.
The last thing that he remembered was the party at the hobbit's house, and they
had great difficulty in making him believe their tale of all the many adventures
they had had since.</p>
<p>When he heard that there was nothing to eat, he sat down and wept, for he
felt very weak and wobbly in the legs. "Why ever did I wake up!" he
cried. "I was having such beautiful dreams. I dreamed I was walking in a
forest rather like this one, only lit with torches on the trees and lamps
swinging from the branches and fires burning on the ground; and there was a
great feast going on, going on for ever. A woodland king was there with a crown
of leaves, and there was a merry singing, and I could not count or describe the
things there were to eat and drink."</p>
<p>"You need not try," said Thorin. "In fact if you can't talk
about something else, you had better be silent. We are quite annoyed enough with
you as it is. If you hadn't waked up, we should have left you to your idiotic
dreams in the forest; you are no joke to carry even after weeks of short
commons."</p>
<p>There was nothing now to be done but to tighten the belts round their empty
stomachs, and hoist their empty sacks and packs, and trudge along the track
without any great hope of ever getting to the end before they lay down and died
of starvation. This they did all that day, going very slowly and wearily, while
Bombur kept on wailing that his legs would not carry him and that he wanted to
lie down and sleep.</p>
<p>"No you don't!" they said. "Let your legs take their share, we
have carried you far enough."</p>
<p>All the same he suddenly refused to go a step further and flung himself on
the ground. "Go on, if you must," he said. "I'm just going to lie
here and sleep and dream of food, if I can't get it any other way. I hope I
never wake up again."</p>
<p>At that very moment Balin, who was a little way ahead, called out: "What
was that? I thought I saw a twinkle of light in the forest."</p>
<p>They all looked, and a longish way off, it seemed, they saw a red twinkle in
the dark; then another and another sprang out beside it. Even Bombur got up, and
they hurried along then, not caring if it was trolls or goblins. The light was
in front of them and to the left of the path, and when at last they had drawn
level with it, it seemed plain that torches and fires were burning under the
trees, but a good way off their track.</p>
<p>"It looks as if my dreams were coming true," gasped Bombur puffing
up behind. He wanted to rush straight off into the wood after the lights. But
the others remembered only too well the warnings of the wizard and of Beorn.
"A feast would be no good, if we never got back alive from it," said
Thorin.</p>
<p>"But without a feast we shan't remain alive much longer anyway,"
said Bombur, and Bilbo heartily agreed with him. They argued about it backwards
and forwards for a long while, until they agreed at length to send out a couple
of spies, to creep near the lights and find out more about them. But then they
could not agree on who was to be sent: no one seemed anxious to run the chance
of being lost and never finding his friends again. In the end, in spite of
warnings, hunger decided them, because Bombur kept on describing all the good
things that were being eaten, according to his dream, in the woodland feast; so
they all left the path and plunged into the forest together.</p>
<p>After a good deal of creeping and crawling they peered round the trunks and
looked into a clearing where some trees had been felled and the ground levelled.
There were many people there, elvish-looking folk, all dressed in green and
brown and sitting on sawn rings of the felled trees in a great circle. There was
a fire in their midst and there were torches fastened to some of the trees round
about; but most splendid sight of all: they were eating and drinking and
laughing merrily.</p>
<p>The smell of the roast meats was so enchanting that, without waiting to
consult one another, every one of them got up and scrambled forwards into the
ring with the one idea of begging for some food. No sooner had the first stepped
into the clearing than all the lights went out as if by magic. Somebody kicked
the fire and it went up in rockets of glittering sparks and vanished. They were
lost in a completely lightless dark and they could not even find one another,
not for a long time at any rate. After blundering frantically in the gloom,
falling over logs, bumping crash into trees, and shouting and calling till they
must have waked everything in the forest for miles, at last they managed to
gather themselves in a bundle and count themselves by touch. By that time they
had, of course, quite forgotten in what direction the path lay, and they were
all hopelessly lost, at least till morning.</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but to settle down for the night where they were;
they did not even dare to search on the ground for scraps of food for fear of
becoming separated again. But they had not been lying long, and Bilbo was only
just getting drowsy, when Dori, whose turn it was to watch first, said in a loud
whisper:</p>
<p>"The lights are coming out again over there, and there are more than
ever of them."</p>
<p>Up they all jumped. There, sure enough, not far away were scores of twinkling
lights, and they heard the voices and the laughter quite plainly. They crept
slowly towards them, in a single line, each touching the back of the one in
front. When they got near Thorin said: "No rushing forward this time! No
one is to stir from hiding till I say. I shall send Mr. Baggins alone first to
talk to them. They won't be frightened of him-('What about me of them?' thought
Bilbo)-and any way I hope they won't do anything nasty to him."</p>
<p>When they got to the edge of the circle of lights they pushed Bilbo suddenly
from behind. Before he had time to slip on his ring, he stumbled forward into
the full blaze of the fire and torches. It was no good. Out went all the lights
again and complete darkness fell. If it had been difficult collecting themselves
before, it was far worse this time. And they simply could not find the hobbit.
Every time they counted themselves it only made thirteen. They shouted and
called: "Bilbo Baggins! Hobbit! You dratted hobbit! Hi! hobbit,
confusticate you, where are you?" and other things of that sort, but there
was no answer.</p>
<p>They were just giving up hope, when Dori stumbled across him by sheer luck.
In the dark he fell over what he thought was a log, and he found it was the
hobbit curled up fast asleep. It took a deal of shaking to wake him, and when he
was awake he was not pleased at all.</p>
<p>"I was having such a lovely dream," he grumbled, "all about
having a most gorgeous dinner."</p>
<p>"Good heavens! he has gone like Bombur," they said. "Don't
tell us about dreams. Dream-dinners aren't any good, and we can't share
them."</p>
<p>"They are the best I am likely to get in this beastly place," he
muttered, as he lay down beside the dwarves and tried to go back to sleep and
find his dream again. But that was not the last of the lights in the forest.
Later when the night must have been getting old, Kili who was watching then,
came and roused them all again, saying:</p>
<p>"There's a regular blaze of light begun not far away - hundreds of
torches and many fires must have been lit suddenly and by magic. And hark to the
singing and the harps!"</p>
<p>After lying and listening for a while, they found they could not resist the
desire to go nearer and try once more to get help. Up they got again; and this
time the result was disastrous. The feast that they now saw was greater and more
magnificent than before; and at the head of a long line of feasters sat a
woodland king with a crown of leaves upon his golden hair, very much as Bombur
had described the figure in his dream. The elvish folk were passing bowls from
hand to hand and across the fires, and some were harping and many were singing.
Their gloaming hair was twined with flowers; green and white gems glinted on
their collars and their belts; and their faces and their songs were filled with
mirth. Loud and clear and fair were those songs, and out stepped Thorin into
their midst.</p>
<p>Dead silence fell in the middle of a word. Out went all light. The fires
leaped up in black smokes. Ashes and cinders were in the eyes of the dwarves,
and the wood was filled again with their clamour and their cries. Bilbo found
himself running round and round (as he thought) and calling and calling:
"Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Fili, Kili, Bombur, Bifur, Bofur, Dwalin,
Balin, Thorin Oakenshield," while people he could not see or feel were
doing the same all round him (with an occasional "Bilbo!" thrown in).
But the cries of the others got steadily further and fainter, and though after a
while it seemed to him they changed to yells and cries for help in the far
distance, all noise at last died right away, and he was left alone in complete
silence and darkness.</p>
<p>That was one of his most miserable moments. But he soon made up his mind that
it was no good trying to do anything till day came with some little light, and
quite useless to go blundering about tiring himself out with no hope of any
breakfast to revive him. So he sat himself down with his back to a tree, and not
for the last time fell to thinking of his far-distant hobbit-hole with its
beautiful pantries. He was deep in thoughts of bacon and eggs and toast and
butter when he felt something touch him. Something like a strong sticky string
was against his left hand, and when he tried to move he found that his legs were
already wrapped in the same stuff, so that when he got up he fell over.</p>
<p>Then the great spider, who had been busy tying him up while he dozed, came
from behind him and came at him. He could only see the things's eyes, but he
could feel its hairy legs as it struggled to wind its abominable threads round
and round him. It was lucky that he had come to his senses in time. Soon he
would not have been able to move at all. As it was, he had a desperate fight
before he got free. He beat the creature off with his hands-it was trying to
poison him to keep him quiet, as small spiders do to flies-until he remembered
his sword and drew it out. Then the spider jumped back, and he had time to cut
his legs loose. After that it was his turn to attack. The spider evidently was
not used to things that carried such stings at their sides, or it would have
hurried away quicker. Bilbo came at it before it could disappear and struck it
with his sword right in the eyes. Then it went mad and leaped and danced and
flung out its legs in horrible jerks, until he killed it with another stroke;
and then he fell down and remembered nothing more for a long while.</p>
<p>There was the usual dim grey light of the forest-day about him when he came
to his senses. The spider lay dead beside him, and his sword-blade was stained
black. Somehow the killing of the giant spider, all alone by himself in the dark
without the help of the wizard or the dwarves or of anyone else, made a great
difference to Mr. Baggins. He felt a different person, and much fiercer and
bolder in spite of an empty stomach, as he wiped his sword on the grass and put
it back into its sheath.</p>
<p>"I will give you a name," he said to it, "and I shall call you
Sting."</p>
<p>After that he set out to explore. The forest was grim and silent, but
obviously he had first of all to look for his friends, who were not likely to be
very far off, unless they had been made prisoners by the elves (or worse
things).</p>
<p>Bilbo felt that it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a long while wondering
in what direction the path lay, and in what direction he should go first to look
for the dwarves. "O! why did we not remember Beorn's advice, and
Gandalf's!" he lamented. "What a mess we are in now! We! I only wish
it was we: it is horrible being all alone."</p>
<p>In the end he made as good a guess as he could at the direction from which
the cries for help had come in the night - and by luck (he was born with a good
share of it) be guessed more or less right, as you will see. Having made up his
mind he crept along as cleverly as he could. Hobbits are clever at quietness,
especially in woods, as 1. have already told you; also Bilbo had slipped on his
ring before he started. That is why the spiders neither saw nor heard him
coming.</p>
<p>He had picked his way stealthily 'for some distance, when he noticed a place
of dense black shadow ahead of him black even for that forest, like a patch of
midnight that had never been cleared away. As he drew nearer, he saw that it was
made by spider-webs one behind and over and tangled with another. Suddenly he
saw, too, that there were spiders huge and horrible sitting in the branches
above him, and ring or no ring he trembled with fear lest they should discover
him. Standing behind a tree he watched a group of them for some time, and then
in the silence and stillness of the wood he realised that these loathsome
creatures were speaking one to another. Their voices were a sort of thin
creaking and hissing, but he could make out many of the words that they said.
They were talking about the dwarves!</p>
<p>"It was a sharp struggle, but worth it," said one. "What nasty
thick skins they have to be sure, but I'll wager there is good juice
inside."</p>
<p>"Aye, they'll make fine eating, when they've hung a bit," said
another.</p>
<p>"Don't hang 'em too long," said a third. "They're not as fat
as they might be. Been feeding none too well of late, I should guess."</p>
<p>"Kill'em, I say," hissed a fourth; "kill 'em now and hang 'em
dead for a while."</p>
<p>"They're dead now, I'll warrant," said the first.</p>
<p>"That they are not. I saw one a-struggling just now. Just coming round
again, I should say, after a bee-autiful sleep. I'll show you."</p>
<p>With that one of the fat spiders ran along a rope, till it came to a dozen
bundles hanging in a row from a high branch. Bilbo was horrified, now that he
noticed them for the first time dangling in the shadows, to see a dwarvish foot
sticking out of the bottoms of some of the bundles, or here and there the tip of
a nose, or a bit of beard or of a hood.</p>
<p>To the fattest of these bundles the spider went--"It is poor old Bombur,
I'll bet," thought Bilbo - and nipped hard at the nose that stuck out.
There was a muffled yelp inside, and a toe shot up and kicked the spider
straight and hard. There was life in Bombur still. There was a noise like the
kicking of a flabby football, and the enraged spider fell off the branch, only
catching itself with its own thread just in time.</p>
<p>The others laughed. "You were quite right," they said, "the
meat's alive and kicking!"</p>
<p>"I'll soon put an end to that," hissed the angry spider climbing
back onto the branch.</p>
<p>Bilbo saw that the moment had come when he must do something. He could not
get up at the brutes and he had nothing to shoot with; but looking about he saw
that in this place there were many stones lying in what appeared to be a now dry
little watercourse. Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and it did not
take him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one that fitted his hand cosily.</p>
<p>As a boy he used to practise throwing stones at things, until rabbits and
squirrels, and even birds, got out of his way as quick as lightning if they saw
him stoop; and even grownup he had still spent a deal of his time at quoits,
dart-throwing, shooting at the wand, bowls, ninepins and other quiet games of
the aiming and throwing sort-indeed he could do lots of things, besides blowing
smoke-rings, asking riddles and cooking, that I haven't had time to tell you
about. There is no time now. While he was picking up stones, the spider had
reached Bombur, and soon he would have been dead. At that moment Bilbo threw.
The stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it dropped senseless off the
tree, flop to the ground, with all its legs curled up.</p>
<p>The next stone went whizzing through a big web, snapping its cords, and
taking off the spider sitting in the middle of it, whack, dead. After that there
was a deal of commotion in the spider-colony, and they forgot the dwarves for a
bit, I can tell you. They could not see Bilbo, but they could make a good guess
at the direction from which the stones were coming. As quick as lightning they
came running and swinging towards the hobbit, flinging out their long threads in
all directions, till the air seemed full of waving snares. Bilbo, however, soon
slipped away to a different place. The idea came to him to lead the furious
spiders further and further away from the dwarves, if he could; to make them
curious, excited and angry all at once. When about fifty had gone off to the
place where he had stood before, he threw some more stones at these, and at
others that had stopped behind; then dancing among the trees he began to sing a
song to infuriate them and bring them all after him, and also to let the dwarves
hear his voice.</p>
<p>This is what he sang:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Old fat spider spinning in a tree!</p>
<p>Old fat spider can't see me!</p>
<p>Attercop! Attercop!</p>
<p>Won't you stop,</p>
<p>Stop your spinning and look for me!</p>
<p>Old Tomnoddy, all big body,</p>
<p>Old Tomnoddy can't spy me!</p>
<p>Attercop! Attercop!</p>
<p>Down you drop!</p>
<p>You'll never catch me up your tree!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>Not very good perhaps, but then you must remember that he had to make it up
himself, on the spur of a very awkward moment. It did what he wanted any way. As
he sang he threw some more stones and stamped. Practically all the spiders in
the place came after him: some dropped to the ground, others raced along the
branches, swung from tree to tree, or cast new ropes across the dark spaces.
They made for his noise far quicker than he had expected. They were frightfully
angry. Quite apart from the stones no spider has ever liked being called
Attercop, and Tomnoddy of course is insulting to anybody.</p>
<p>Off Bilbo scuttled to a fresh place, but several of the spiders had run now
to different points in the glade where they lived, and were busy spinning webs
across all the spaces between the tree-stems. Very soon the hobbit would be
caught in a thick fence of them all round him-that at least was the spiders'
idea. Standing now in the middle of the hunting and spinning insects Bilbo
plucked up his courage and began a new song:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lazy Lob and crazy Cob</p>
<p>are weaving webs to wind me.</p>
<p>I am far more sweet than other meat,</p>
<p>but still they cannot find me!</p>
<p>Here am I, naughty little fly;</p>
<p>you are fat and lazy.</p>
<p>You cannot trap me, though you try,</p>
<p>in your cobwebs crazy.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>With that he turned and found that the last space between two tall trees had
been closed with a web-but luckily not a proper web, only great strands of
double-thick spider-rope run hastily backwards and forwards from trunk to trunk.
Out came his little' sword. He slashed the threads to pieces and went off
singing.</p>
<p>The spiders saw the sword, though I don't suppose they knew what it was, and
at once the whole lot of them came hurrying after the hobbit along the ground
and the branches, hairy legs waving, nippers and spinners snapping, eyes
popping, full of froth and rage. They followed him into the forest until Bilbo
had gone as far as he dared.</p>
<p>Then quieter than a mouse he stole back. He had precious little time, he
knew, before the spiders were disgusted and came back to their trees where the
dwarves were hung. In the meanwhile he had to rescue them. The worst part of the
job was getting up on to the long branch where the bundles were dangling. I
don't suppose he would have managed it, if a spider had not luckily left a rope
hanging down; with its help, though it stuck to his hand and hurt him, he
scrambled up-only to meet an old slow wicked fat-bodied spider who had remained
behind to guard the prisoners, and had been busy pinching them to see which was
the juiciest to eat. It had thought of starting the feast while the others were
away, but Mr. Baggins was in a hurry, and before the spider knew what was
happening it felt his sting and rolled off the branch dead. Bilbo's next job was
to loose a dwarf. What was he to do? If he cut the string which hung him up, the
wretched dwarf would tumble thump to the ground a good way below. Wriggling
along the branch (which made all the poor dwarves dance and dangle like ripe
fruit) he reached the first bundle.</p>
<p>"Fili or Kili," he thought by the tip of a blue hood sticking out
at the top. "Most likely Fili," he thought by the tip of a long nose
poking out of the winding threads. He managed by leaning over to cut most of the
strong sticky threads that bound him round, and then, sure enough, with a kick
and a struggle most of Fili emerged. I am afraid Bilbo actually laughed at the
sight of him jerking his stiff arms and legs as he danced on the spider-string
under his armpits, just like one of those funny toys bobbing on a wire.</p>
<p>Somehow or other Fili was got on to the branch, and then he did his best to
help the hobbit, although he was feeling very sick and ill from spider-poison,
and from hanging most of the night and the next day wound round and round with
only his nose to breathe through. It took him ages to get the beastly stuff out
of his eyes and eyebrows, and as for his beard, he had to cut most of it off.
Well, between them they started to haul up first one dwarf and then another and
slash them free. None of them were better off than Fili, and some of them were
worse. Some had hardly been able to breathe at all (long noses are sometimes
useful you see), and some had been more poisoned.</p>
<p>In this way they rescued Kili, Bifur, Bofur, Don and Nori. Poor old Bombur
was so exhausted-he was the fattest and had been constantly pinched and
poked-that he just rolled off the branch and fell plop on to the ground,
fortunately on to leaves, and lay there. But there were still five dwarves
hanging at the end of the branch when the spiders began to come back, more full
of rage than ever. Bilbo immediately went to the end of the branch nearest the
tree-trunk and kept back those that crawled up. He had taken off his ring when
he rescued Fili and forgotten to put it on again, so now they all began to
splutter and hiss:</p>
<p>"Now we see you, you nasty little creature! We will eat you and leave
your bones and skin hanging on a tree. Ugh! he's got a sting has he? Well, we'll
get him all the same, and then we'll hang him head downwards for a day or
two."</p>
<p>While this was going on, the other dwarves were working at the rest of the
captives, and cutting at the threads with their knives. Soon all would be free,
though it was not clear what would happen after that. The spiders had caught
them pretty easily the night before, but that had been unawares and in the dark.
This time there looked like being a horrible battle.</p>
<p>Suddenly Bilbo noticed that some of the spiders had gathered round old Bombur
on the floor, and had tied him up again and were dragging him away. He gave a
shout and slashed at the spiders in front of him. They quickly gave way, and he
scrambled and fell down the tree right into the middle of those on the ground.
His little sword was something new in the way of stings for them. How it darted
to and fro! It shone with delight as he stabbed at them. Half a dozen were
killed before the rest drew off and left Bombur to Bilbo.</p>
<p>"Come down! Come down!" he shouted to the dwarves on the branch.
"Don't stay up there and be netted!" For he saw spiders swarming up
all the neighbouring trees, and crawling along the boughs above the heads of the
dwarves.</p>
<p>Down the dwarves scrambled or jumped or dropped, eleven all in a heap, most
of them very shaky and little use on their legs. There they were at last, twelve
of them counting poor old Bombur, who was being propped up on either side by his
cousin Bifur, and his brother Bofur; and Bilbo was dancing about and waving his
Sting; and hundreds of angry spiders were goggling at them all round and about
and above. It looked pretty hopeless.</p>
<p>Then the battle began. Some of the dwarves had knives, and some had sticks,
and all of them could get at stones; and Bilbo had his elvish dagger. Again and
again the spiders were beaten off, and many of them were killed. But it could
not go on for long. Bilbo was nearly tired out; only four of the dwarves were
able to stand firmly, and soon they would all be overpowered like weary flies.
Already the spiders were beginning to weave their webs all round them again from
tree to tree. In the end Bilbo could think of no plan except to let the dwarves
into the secret of his ring. He was rather sorry about it, but it could not be
helped.</p>
<p>"I am going to disappear," he said. "I shall draw the spiders
off, if I can; and you must keep together and make in the opposite direction. To
the left there, that is more or less the way towards the place where we last saw
the elf-fires."</p>
<p>It was difficult to get them to understand, what with their dizzy heads, and
the shouts, and the whacking of sticks and the throwing of stones; but at last
Bilbo felt he could delay no longer-the spiders were drawing their circle ever
closer. He suddenly slipped on his ring, and to the great astonishment of the
dwarves he vanished.</p>
<p>Soon there came the sound of "Lazy Lob" and "Attercop"
from among the trees away on the right. That upset the spiders greatly. They
stopped advancing, and some, went off in the direction of the voice.
"Attercop" made them so angry that they lost their wits. Then Balin,
who had grasped Bilbo's plan better than the rest, led an attack. The dwarves
huddled together in a knot, and sending a shower of stones they drove at the
spiders on the left, and burst through the ring. Away behind them now the
shouting and singing suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Hoping desperately that Bilbo had not been caught the dwarves went on. Not
fast enough, though. They were sick and weary, and they could not go much better
than a hobble and a wobble, though many of the spiders were close behind. Every
now and then they had to turn and fight the creatures that were overtaking them
and already some spiders were in the trees above them and throwing down their
long clinging threads.</p>
<p>Things were looking pretty bad again, when suddenly Bilbo appeared and
charged into the astonished spiders unexpectedly from the side.</p>
<p>"Go on! Go on!" he shouted. "I will do the stinging!" And
he did. He darted backwards and forwards, slashing at spider-threads, hacking at
their legs, and stabbing at their fat bodies if they came too near. The spiders
swelled with rage, and spluttered and frothed, and hissed out horrible curses;
but they had become mortally afraid of Sting, and dared not come very near, now
that it had come back. So curse as they would, their prey moved slowly but
steadily away. It was a most terrible business, and seemed to take hours. But at
last, just when Bilbo felt that he could not lift his hand for a single stroke
more, the spiders suddenly gave it up, and followed them no more, but went back
disappointed to their dark colony.</p>
<p>The dwarves then noticed that they had come to the edge of a ring where
elf-fires had been. Whether it was one of those they had seen the night before,
they could not tell. But it seemed that some good magic lingered in such spots,
which the spiders did not like. At any rate here the light was greener, and the
boughs less thick and threatening, and they had a chance to rest and draw
breath.</p>
<p>There they lay for some time, puffing and panting. put very soon they began
to ask questions. They had to have the whole vanishing business carefully
explained, and the finding of the ring interested them so much that for a while
they forgot their own troubles. Balin in particular insisted on having the
Gollum story, riddles and all, told all over again, with the ring in its proper
place. But after a time the light began to fail, and then other questions were
asked. Where were they, and where was their path, and where was there any food,
and what were they going to do next? These questions they asked over and over
again, and it was from little Bilbo that they seemed to expect to get the
answers. From which you can see that they had changed their opinion of Mr.
Baggins very much, and had begun to have a great respect for him (as Gandalf had
said they would). Indeed they really expected him to think of some wonderful
plan for helping them, and were not merely grumbling. They knew only too well
that they would soon all have been dead, if it had not been for the hobbit; and
they thanked him many times. Some of them even got up and bowed right to the
ground before him, though they fell over with the effort, and could not get on
their legs again for some time. Knowing the truth about the vanishing did not
lessen their opinion of Bilbo at all; for they saw that he had some wits, as
well as luck and a magic ring-and all three are very useful possessions. In fact
they praised him so much that Bilbo began to feel there really was something of
a bold adventurer about himself after all, though he I would have felt a lot
bolder still, if there had been anything to eat.</p>
<p>But there was nothing, nothing at all; and none of them Were fit to go and
look for anything, or to search for the lost path. The lost path! No other idea
would come into Bilbo's tired head. He just sat staring in front of him at the
endless trees; and after a while they all fell silent again. All except Balin.
Long after the others had stopped talking and shut their eyes, he kept on
muttering and chuckling to himself.</p>
<p>"Gollum! Well I'm blest! So that's how he sneaked past me is it? Now I
know! Just crept quietly along did you, Mr. Baggins? Buttons all over the
doorstep? Good old Bilbo-Bilbo-Bilbo-bo-bo-bo-" And then he fell asleep,
and there was complete silence for a long time.</p>
<p>All of a sudden Dwalin opened an eye, and looked round at them. "Where
is Thorin?" he asked. It was a terrible shock. Of course there were only
thirteen of them, twelve dwarves and the hobbit. Where indeed was Thorin? They
wondered what evil fate had befallen him, magic or dark monsters; and shuddered
as they lay lost in the forest. There they dropped off one by one into
uncomfortable sleep full of horrible dreams, as evening wore to black night; and
there we must leave them for the present, too sick and weary to set guards or
take turns watching.</p>
<p>Thorin had been caught much faster than they had. You remember Bilbo falling
like a log into sleep, as he stepped into a circle of light? The next time it
had been Thorin who stepped forward, and as the lights went out he fell like a
stone enchanted. All the noise of the dwarves lost in the night, their cries as
the spiders caught them and bound them, and all the sounds of the battle next
day, had passed over him unheard. Then the Wood-elves had come to him, and bound
him, and carried him away. The feasting people were Wood-elves, of course. These
are not wicked folk. If they have a fault it is distrust of strangers. Though
their magic was strong, even in those days they were wary. They differed from
the High Elves of the West, and were more dangerous and less wise. For most of
them (together with their scattered relations in the hills and mountains) were
descended from the ancient tribes that never went to Faerie in the West. There
the Light-elves and the Deep-elves and the Sea-elves went and lived for ages,
and grew fairer and wiser and more learned, and invented their magic and their
cunning craft, in the making of beautiful and marvellous things, before some
came back into the Wide World. In the Wide World the Wood-elves lingered in the
twilight of our Sun and Moon but loved best the stars; and they wandered in the
great forests that grew tall in lands that are now lost. They dwelt most often
by the edges of the woods, from which they could escape at times to hunt, or to
ride and run over the open lands by moonlight or starlight; and after the coming
of Men they took ever more and more to the gloaming and the dusk. Still elves
they were and remain, and that is Good People.</p>
<p>In a great cave some miles within the edge of Mirkwood on its eastern side
there lived at this time their greatest king. Before his huge doors of stone a
river ran out of the heights of the forest and flowed on and out into the
marshes at the feet of the high wooded lands. This great cave, from which
countless smaller ones opened out on every side, wound far underground and had
many passages and wide halls; but it was lighter and more wholesome than any
goblin-dwelling, and neither so deep nor so dangerous. In fact the subjects of
the king mostly lived and hunted in the open woods, and had houses or huts on
the ground and in the branches. The beeches were their favourite trees. The
king's cave was his palace, and the strong place of his treasure, and the
fortress of his people against their enemies.</p>
<p>It was also the dungeon of his prisoners. So to the cave they dragged
Thorin-not too gently, for they did not love dwarves, and thought he was an
enemy. In ancient days they had had wars with some of the dwarves, whom they
accused of stealing their treasure. It is only fair to say that the dwarves gave
a different account, and said that they only took what was their due, for the
elf-king had bar- gained with them to shape his raw gold and silver, and had
afterwards refused to give them their pay. If the elf-king had a weakness it was
for treasure, especially for silver and white gems; and though his hoard was
rich, he was ever eager for more, since he had not yet as great a treasure as
other elf-lords of old. His people neither mined nor worked metals or jewels,
nor did they bother much with trade or with tilling the earth. All this was well
known to every dwarf, though Thorin's family had had nothing to do with the old
quarrel I have spoken of. Consequently Thorin was angry at their treatment of
him, when they took their spell off him and he came to his senses; and also he
was determined that no word of gold or jewels should be dragged out of him.</p>
<p>The king looked sternly on Thorin, when he was brought before him, and asked
him many questions. But Thorin would only say that he was starving.</p>
<p>"Why did you and your folk three times try to attack my people at their
merrymaking?" asked the king.</p>
<p>"We did not attack them," answered Thorin; "we came to beg,
because we were starving."</p>
<p>"Where are your friends now, and what are they doing?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, but I expect starving in the forest."</p>
<p>"What were you doing in the forest?"</p>
<p>"Looking for food and drink, because we were starving."</p>
<p>"But what brought you into the forest at all?" asked the king
angrily.</p>
<p>At that Thorin shut his mouth and would not say another word.</p>
<p>"Very well!" said the king. "Take him away and keep him safe,
until he feels inclined to tell the truth, even if he waits a hundred
years.'"</p>
<p>Then the elves put thongs on him, and shut him in one of the inmost caves
with strong wooden doors, and left him. They gave him food and drink, plenty of
both, if not very fine; for Wood-elves were not goblins, and were reasonably
well-behaved even to their worst enemies, when they captured them. The giant
spiders were the only living things that they had no mercy upon.</p>
<p>There in the king's dungeon poor Thorin lay; and after he had got over his
thankfulness for bread and meat and water, he began to wonder what had become of
his unfortunate friends. It was not very long before he discovered; but that
belongs to the next chapter and the beginning of another adventure in which the
hobbit again showed his usefulness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<h2>Barrels Out of Bond</h2>
<p>The day after the battle with the spiders Bilbo and the dwarves made one last
despairing effort to find a way out before they died of hunger and thirst. They
got up and staggered on in the direction which eight out of the thirteen of them
guessed to be the one in which the path lay; but they never found out if they
were right. Such day as there ever was in the forest was fading once more into
the blackness of night, when suddenly out sprang the light of many torches all
round them, like hundreds of red stars. Out leaped Wood-elves with their bows
and spears and called the dwarves to halt.</p>
<p>There was no thought of a fight. Even if the dwarves had not been in such a
state that they were actually glad to be captured, their small knives, the only
weapons they had, would have been of no use against the arrows of the elves that
could hit a bird's eye in the dark. So they simply stopped dead and sat down and
waited-all except Bilbo, who popped on his ring and slipped quickly to one side.</p>
<p>That is why, when the elves bound the dwarves in a long line, one behind the
other, and counted them, they never found or counted the hobbit. Nor did they
hear or feel him trotting along well behind their torch-light as they led off
their prisoners into the forest. Each dwarf was blindfold, but that did not make
much difference, for even Bilbo with the use of his eyes could not see where
they were going, and neither he nor the others knew where they had started from
anyway. Bilbo had all he could do to keep up with the torches, for the elves
were making the dwarves go as fast as ever they could, sick and weary as they
were. The king had ordered them to make haste. Suddenly the torches stopped, and
the hobbit had just time to catch them up before they began to cross the bridge.
This was the bridge that led across the river to the king's doors. The water
flowed dark and swift and strong beneath; and at the far end were gates before
the mouth of a huge cave that ran into the side of a steep slope covered with
trees. There the great beeches came right down to the bank, till their feet were
in the stream. Across this bridge the elves thrust their prisoners, but Bilbo
hesitated in the rear. He did not at all like the look of the cavern-mouth and
he only made up his mind not to desert his friends just in time to scuttle over
at the heels of the fast elves, before the great gates of the king closed behind
them with a clang.</p>
<p>Inside the passages were lit with red torch-light, and the elf-guards sang as
they marched along the twisting, crossing, and echoing paths. These were not
like those of the goblin-cities: they were smaller, less deep underground, and
filled with a cleaner air. In a great hall with pillars hewn out of the living
stone sat the Elvenking on a chair of carven wood. On his head was a crown of
berries and red leaves, for the autumn was come again. In the spring he wore a
crown of woodland flowers. In his hand he held a carven staff of oak.</p>
<p>The prisoners were brought before him; and though he looked grimly at them,
he told his men to unbind them, for they were ragged and weary. "Besides
they need no ropes in here," said he. "There is no escape from my
magic doors for those who are once brought inside."</p>
<p>Long and searchingly he questioned the dwarves about their doings, and where
they were going to, and where they were coming from; but he got little more news
out of them than out of Thorin. They were surly and angry and did not even
pretend to be polite.</p>
<p>"What have we done, O king?" said Balin, who was the eldest left.
"Is it a crime to be lost in the forest, to be hungry and thirsty, to be
trapped by spiders? Are the spiders your tame beasts or your pets, if killing
them makes you angry?" Such a question of course made the king angrier than
ever, and he answered: "It is a crime to wander in my realm without leave.
Do you forget that you were in my kingdom, using the road that my people made?
Did you not three times pursue and trouble my people in the forest and ' rouse
the spiders with your riot and clamour? After all the disturbance you have made
I have a right to know what brings you here, and if you will not tell me now, I
will keep you all in prison until you have learned sense and manners!"</p>
<p>Then he ordered the dwarves each to be put in a separate cell and to be given
food and drink, but not to be allowed to pass the doors of their little prisons,
until one at least of them was willing to tell him all he wanted to know. But be
did not tell them that Thorin was also a prisoner with him. It was Bilbo who
found that out.</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Baggins - it was a weary long time that he lived in that place all
alone, and always in hiding, never daring to take off his ring, hardly daring to
sleep, even tucked away in the darkest and remotest comers he could find. For
something to do he took to wandering about the Elven-king's palace. Magic shut
the gates, but be could sometimes get out, if he was quick. Companies of the
Wood-elves, sometimes with the king at their head, would from time to time ride
out to hunt, or to other business in the woods and in the lands to the East.
Then if Bilbo was very nimble, he could slip out just behind them; though it was
a dangerous thing to do. More than once he was nearly caught in the doors, as
they clashed together when the last elf passed; yet he did not dare to march
among them because of his shadow (altogether thin and wobbly as it was in
torch-light), or for fear of being bumped into and discovered. And when he did
go out, which was not very often, he did no good. He did not wish to desert the
dwarves, and indeed he did not know where in the world to go without them. He
could not keep up with the hunting elves all the time they were out, so he never
discovered the ways out of the wood, and was left to wander miserably in the
forest, terrified of losing himself, until a chance came of returning. He was
hungry too outside, for he was no hunter; but inside the caves he could pick up
a living of some sort by stealing food from store or table when no one was at
hand. "I am like a burglar that can't get away, but must go on miserably
burgling the same house day after day," he thought. "This is the
dreariest and dullest part of all this wretched, tiresome, uncomfortable
adventure! I wish I was back in my hobbit-hole by my own warm fireside with the
lamp shining!" He often wished, too, that he could get a message for help
sent to the wizard, but that of course was quite impossible; and he soon
realized that if anything was to be done, it would have to be done by Mr.
Baggins, alone and unaided.</p>
<p>Eventually, after a week or two of this sneaking sort of life, by watching
and following the guards and taking what chances he could, he managed to find
out where each dwarf was kept. He found all their twelve cells in different
parts of the palace, and after a time he got to know his way about very well.
What was his surprise one day to overhear some of the guards talking and to
learn that there was another dwarf in prison too, in a specially deep dark
place. He guessed at once, of course, that that was Thorin; and after a while he
found that his guess was right. At last after many difficulties he managed to
find the place when no one was about, and to have a word with the chief of the
dwarves. Thorin was too wretched to be angry any longer at his misfortunes, and
was even beginning to think of telling the king all about his treasure and his
quest (which shows how low-spirited he had become), when he heard Bilbo's little
voice at his keyhole. He could hardly believe his ears. Soon however he made up
his mind that he could not be mistaken, and he came to the door and had a long
whispered talk with the hobbit on the other side.</p>
<p>So it was that Bilbo was able to take secretly Thorin's message to each of
the other imprisoned dwarves, telling them that Thorin their chief was also in
prison close at hand, and that no one was to reveal their errand to the long,
not yet, not before Thorin gave the word. For Thorin had taken heart again
hearing how the hobbit had rescued his companions from the spiders, and was
determined once more not to ransom himself with promises to the king of a share
in the treasure, until all hope of escaping in any other way had disappeared;
until in fact the remarkable Mr. Invisible Baggins (of whom he began to have a
very high opinion indeed) had altogether failed to think of something clever.</p>
<p>The other dwarves quite agreed when they got the message. They all thought
their own shares in the treasure (which they quite regarded as theirs, in spite
of their plight and the still unconquered dragon) would suffer seriously if the
Wood-elves claimed part of it, and they all trusted Bilbo. Just what Gandalf had
said would happen, you see. Perhaps that war part of his reason for going off
and leaving them.</p>
<p>Bilbo, however, did not feel nearly so hopeful as they did. He did not like
being depended on by everyone, and he wished he had the wizard at hand. But that
was no use: probably all the dark distance of Mirkwood lay between them. He sat
and thought and thought, until his head nearly burst, but no bright idea would
come. One invisible ring was a very fine thing, but it was not much good among
fourteen. But of course, as you have guessed, he did rescue his friends in the
end, and this is how it happened. One day, nosing and wandering about. Bilbo
discovered a very interesting thing: the great gates were not the only entrance
to the caves. A stream flowed under part of the lowest regions of the palace,
and joined the Forest River some way further to the east, beyond the steep slope
out of which the main mouth opened. Where this underground watercourse came
forth from the hillside there was a water-gate. There the rocky roof came down
close to the surface of the stream, and from it a portcullis could be dropped
right to the bed of the river to prevent anyone coming in or out that way. But
the portcullis was often open, for a good deal of traffic went out and in by the
water-gate. If anyone had come in that way, he would have found himself in a
dark rough tunnel leading deep into the heart of the hill; but at one point
where it passed under the caves the roof had been cut away and covered with
great oaken trapdoors. These opened upwards into the king's cellars. There stood
barrels, and barrels, and barrels; for the Wood-elves, and especially their
king, were very fond of wine, though no vines grew in those parts. The wine, and
other goods, were brought from far away, from their kinsfolk in the South, or
from the vineyards of Men in distant lands.</p>
<p>Hiding behind one of the largest barrels Bilbo discovered the trapdoors and
their use, and lurking there, listening to the talk of the king's servants, he
learned how the wine and other goods came up the rivers, or over land, to the
Long Lake. It seemed a town of Men still throve there, built out on bridges far
into the water as a protection against enemies of all sorts, and especially
against the dragon of the Mountain. From Lake-town the barrels were brought up
the Forest River. Often they were just tied together like big rafts and poled or
rowed up the stream; sometimes they were loaded on to flat boats.</p>
<p>When the barrels were empty the elves cast them through the trapdoors, opened
the water-gate, and out the barrels floated on the stream, bobbing along, until
they were carried by the current to a place far down the river where the bank
jutted out, near to the very eastern edge of Mirkwood. There they were collected
and tied together and floated back to Lake-town, which stood close to the point
where the Forest River flowed into the Long Lake.</p>
<p>For some time Bilbo sat and thought about this water-gate, and wondered if it
could be used for the escape of his friends, and at last he had the desperate
beginnings of a plan.</p>
<p>The evening meal had been taken to the prisoners. The guards were tramping
away down the passages taking the torch-light with them and leaving everything
in darkness. Then Bilbo heard the king's butler bidding the chief of the guards
good-night.</p>
<p>"Now come with me," he said, "and taste the new wine that has
just come in. I shall be hard at work tonight clearing the cellars of the empty
wood, so let us have a drink first to help the labour."</p>
<p>"Very good," laughed the chief of the guards. "I'll taste with
you, and see if it is fit for the king's table. There is a feast tonight and it
would not do to send up poor stuff!"</p>
<p>When he heard this Bilbo was all in a flutter, for he saw that luck was with
him and he had a chance at once to try his desperate plan. He followed the two
elves, until they entered a small cellar and sat down at a table on which two
large flagons were set. Soon they began to drink and laugh merrily. Luck of an
unusual kind was with Bilbo then. It must be potent wine to make a wood-elf
drowsy; but this wine, it would seem, was the heady vintage of the great gardens
of Dorwinion, not meant for his soldiers or his servants, but for the king's
feasts only, and for smaller bowls, not for the butler's great flagons.</p>
<p>Very soon the chief guard nodded his head, then he laid it on the table and
fell fast asleep. The butler went on talking and laughing to himself for a while
without seeming to notice, but soon his head too nodded to the table, and he
fell asleep and snored beside his friend. Then in crept the hobbit. Very soon
the chief guard had no keys, but Bilbo was trotting as fast as he could along
the passage towards the cells. The great bunch seemed very heavy to his arms,
and his heart was often in his mouth, in spite of his ring, for he could not
prevent the keys from making every now and then a loud clink and clank, which
put him all in a tremble.</p>
<p>First he unlocked Balin's door, and locked it again carefully as soon as the
dwarf was outside. Balin was most surprised, as you can imagine; but glad as he
was to get out of his wearisome little stone room, he wanted to stop and ask
questions, and know what Bilbo was going to do, and all about it.</p>
<p>"No time now!" said the hobbit. "You must follow me! We must
all keep together and not risk getting separated. All of us must escape or none,
and this is our last chance. If this is found out, goodness knows where the king
will put you next, with chains on your hands and feet too, I expect. Don't
argue, there's a good fellow!"</p>
<p>Then off he went from door to door, until his following had grown to
twelve-none of them any too nimble, what with the dark, and what with their long
imprisonment. Bilbo's heart thumped every time one of them bumped into another,
or grunted or whispered in the dark. "Drat this dwarvish racket!" he
said to himself. But all went well, and they met no guards. As a matter of fact
there was a great autumn feast in the woods that night, and in the halls above.
Nearly all the king's folks were merrymaking. At last after much blundering they
came to Thorin's dungeon, far down in a deep place and fortunately not far from
the cellars.</p>
<p>"Upon my word!" said Thorin, when Bilbo whispered to him to come
out and join his friends, "Gandalf spoke true, as usual. A pretty fine
burglar you make, it seems, when the time comes. I am sure we are all for ever
at your service, whatever happens after this. But what comes next?"</p>
<p>Bilbo saw that the time had come to explain his idea, as far as he could; but
he did not feel at all sure bow the dwarves would take it. His fears were quite
justified, for they did not like it a bit, and started grumbling loudly in spite
of their danger.</p>
<p>"We shall be bruised and battered to pieces, and drowned too, for
certain!" they muttered. "We thought you had got some sensible notion,
when you managed to get hold of the keys. This is a mad idea!"</p>
<p>"Very well!" said Bilbo very downcast, and also rather annoyed.
"Come along back to your nice cells, and I will lock you all in again, and
you can sit there comfortably and think of a better plan-but I don't suppose I
shall ever get hold of the keys again, even if I feel inclined to try."</p>
<p>"That was too much for them, and they calmed down. In the end, of
course, they had to do just what Bilbo suggested, because it was obviously
impossible for them to try and find their way into the upper halls, or to fight
their way out of gates that closed by magic; and it was no good grumbling in the
passages until they were caught again. So following the hobbit, down into the
lowest cellars they crept. They passed a door through which the chief guard and
the butler could be seen still happily snoring with smiles upon their faces. The
wine of Dorwinion brings deep and pleasant dreams. There would be a different
expression on the face of the chief guard next day, even though Bilbo, before
they went on, stole in and kind-heartedly put the keys back on his belt.</p>
<p>"That will save him some of the trouble he is in for," said Mr.
Baggins to himself. "He wasn't a bad fellow, and quite decent to the
prisoners. It will puzzle them all too. They will think we had a very strong
magic to pass through all those locked doors and disappear. Disappear! We have
got to get busy very quick, if that is to happen!"</p>
<p>Balin was told off to watch the guard and the butler and give warning if they
stirred. The rest went into the adjoining cellar with the trapdoors. There was
little time to lose. Before long, as Bilbo knew, some elves were under orders to
come down and help the butler get the empty barrels through the doors into the
stream. These were in fact already standing in rows in the middle of the floor
waiting to be pushed off. Some of them were wine-barrels, and these were not
much use, as they could not easily be opened at the end without a deal of noise,
nor could they easily be secured again. But among them were several others which
had been used for bringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of
things, to the king's palace.</p>
<p>They soon found thirteen with room enough for a dwarf in each. In fact some
were too roomy, and as they climbed in the dwarves thought anxiously of the
shaking and the bumping they would get inside, though Bilbo did his best to find
straw and other stuff to pack them in as cosily as could be managed in a short
time. At last twelve dwarves were stowed. Thorin had given a lot of trouble, and
turned and twisted in his tub and grumbled like a large dog in a small kennel;
while Balin, who came last, made a great fuss about his air-holes and said he
was stifling, even before his lid was on. Bilbo had done what he could to close
holes in the sides of the barrels, and to fix on all the lids as safely as could
be managed, and now he was left alone again, running round putting the finishing
touches-to the packing, and hoping against hope that his plan would come off.</p>
<p>It had not been a-bit too soon. Only a minute or two after Balin's lid had
been fitted on there came the sound of voices and the flicker of lights. A
number of elves came laughing and talking into the cellars and singing snatches
of song. They had left a merry feast in one of the halls and were bent on
returning as soon as they could. "Where's old Galion, the butler?"
said one. "I haven't seen him at the tables tonight. He ought to be here
now to show us what is to be done."</p>
<p>"I shall be angry if the old slowcoach is late," said another.
"I have no wish to waste time down here while the song is up!"</p>
<p>"Ha, ha!" came a cry. "Here's the old villain with his head on
a jug! He's been having a little feast all to himself and his friend the
captain."</p>
<p>"Shake him! Wake him!" shouted the others impatiently. Gallon was
not at all pleased at being shaken or wakened, and still less at being laughed
at. "You're all late," he grumbled. "Here am I waiting and
waiting down here, while you fellows drink and make merry and forget your tasks.
Small wonder if I fall asleep from weariness!"</p>
<p>"Small wonder," said they, "when the explanation stands close
at hand in a jug! Come give us a taste of your sleeping-draught before we fall
to! No need to wake the turnkey yonder. He has had his share by the looks of
it."</p>
<p>Then they drank once round and became mighty merry all of a sudden. But they
did not quite lose their wits. "Save us, Galion!" cried some,
"you began your feasting early and muddled your wits! You have stacked some
full casks here instead of the empty ones, if there is anything in weight."</p>
<p>"Get on with the work!" growled the butler. "There is nothing
in the feeling of weight in an idle toss-pot's arms. These are the ones to go
and no others. Do as I say!"</p>
<p>"Very well, very well," they answered rolling the barrels to the
opening. "On your head be it, if the king's full buttertubs and his best
wine is pushed into the river for the Lake-men to feast on for nothing!"</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Roll-roll-roll-roll,</p>
<p>roll-roll-rolling down the hole !</p>
<p>Heave ho! Splash plump !</p>
<p>Down they go, down they bump!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>So they sang as first one barrel and then another rumbled to the dark opening
and was pushed over into the cold water some feet below. Some were barrels
really empty, some were tubs neatly packed with a dwarf each; but down they all
went, one after another, with many a clash and a bump, thudding on top of ones
below, smacking into the water, jostling against the walls of the tunnel,
knocking into one another, and bobbing away down the current.</p>
<p>It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in
his plan. Most likely you saw it some time ago and have been laughing at him;
but I don't suppose you would have done half as well yourselves in his place. Of
course he was not in a barrel himself, nor was there anyone to pack him in, even
if there had been a chance! It looked as if he would certainly lose his friends
this time (nearly all of them had already disappeared through the dark
trap-door), and get utterly left behind and have to stay lurking as a permanent
burglar in the elf-caves for ever. For even if he could have escaped through the
upper gates at once, he had precious small chance of ever finding the dwarves
again. He did not know the way by land to the place where the barrels were
collected. He wondered what on earth would happen to them without him; for he
had not had time to tell the dwarves all that he had learned, or what he had
meant to do, once they were out of the wood. While all these thoughts were
passing through his mind, the elves being very merry began to sing a song round
the river-door. Some had already gone to haul on the ropes which pulled up the
portcullis at the water-gate so as to let out the barrels as soon as they were
all afloat below.</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Down the swift dark stream you go</p>

</blockquote>
</i>
<p>Now the very last barrel was being rolled to the doors! In despair and not
knowing what else to do, poor little Bilbo caught hold of it and was pushed over
the edge with it. Down into the water he fell, splash! into the cold dark water
with the barrel on top of him. He came up again spluttering and clinging to the
wood like a rat, but for all his efforts he could not scramble on top. Every
time he tried, the barrel rolled round and ducked him under again. It was really
empty, and floated light as a cork. Though his ears were full of water, he could
hear the elves still singing in the cellar above. Then suddenly the trapdoors
fell to with a boom and their voices faded away. He was in the dark tunnel,
floating in icy water, all alone-for you cannot count friends that are all
packed up in barrels.</p>
<p>Very soon a grey patch came up in the darkness ahead. He heard the creak of
the water-gate being hauled up, and he found that he was in the midst of a
bobbing and bumping mass of casks and tubs all pressing together to pass under
the arch and get out into the open stream. He had as much as he could do to
prevent himself from being hustled and battered to bits; but at last the
jostling crowd began to break up and swing off, one by one, under the stone arch
and away. Then he saw that it would have been no good even if he had managed to
get astride his barrel, for there was no room to spare, not even for a hobbit,
between its top and the suddenly stooping roof where the gate was.</p>
<p>Out they went under the overhanging branches of the trees on either bank.
Bilbo wondered what the dwarves were feeling and whether a lot of water was
getting into their tubs. Some of those that bobbed along by him in the gloom
seemed pretty low in the water, and he guessed that these had dwarves inside.</p>
<p>"I do hope I put the lids on tight enough!" he thought, but before
long he was worrying too much about himself to remember the dwarves. He managed
to keep his head above the water, but he was shivering with the cold, and he
wondered if he would die of it before the luck turned, and how much longer he
would be able to hang on, and whether he should risk the chance of letting go
and trying to swim to the bank.</p>
<p>The luck turned all right before long: the eddying current carried several
barrels close ashore at one point and there for a while they stuck against some
hidden root. Then Bilbo took the opportunity of scrambling up the side of his
barrel while it was held steady against another. Up he crawled like a drowned
rat, and lay on the top spread out to keep the balance as best he could. The
breeze was cold but better than the water, and he hoped he would not suddenly
roll off again when they started off once more. Before long the barrels broke
free again and turned and twisted off down the stream, and out into the main
current Then he found it quite as difficult to stick on as he had feared; but he
managed it somehow, though it was miserably uncomfortable. Luckily he was very
light, and the barrel was a good big one and being rather leaky had now shipped
a small amount of water. All the same it was like trying to ride, without bridle
or stirrups, a round-bellied pony that was always thinking of rolling on the
grass. In this way at last Mr. Baggins came to a place where the trees on either
hand grew thinner. He could see the paler sky between them. The dark river
opened suddenly wide, and there it was joined to the main water of the Forest
River flowing down in haste from the king's great doors. There was a dim sheet
of water no longer overshadowed, and on its sliding surface there were dancing
and broken reflections of clouds and of stars. Then the hurrying water of the
Forest River swept all the company of casks and tubs away to the north bank, in
which it had eaten out a wide bay. This had a shingly shore under hanging banks
and was walled at the eastern end by a little jutting cape of hard rock. On the
shallow shore most of the barrels ran aground, though a few went on to bump
against the stony pier.</p>
<p>There were people on the look-out on the banks. They quickly poled and pushed
all the barrels together into the shallows, and when they had counted them they
roped them together and left them till the morning. Poor dwarves! Bilbo was not
so badly off now. He slipped from his barrel and waded ashore, and then sneaked
along to some huts that he could see near the water's edge. He no longer thought
twice about picking up a supper uninvited if he got the chance, he had been
obliged to do it for so long, and he knew only too well what it was to be really
hungry, not merely politely interested in the dainties of a well-filled larder.
Also he had caught a glimpse of a fire through the trees, and that appealed to
him with his dripping and ragged clothes clinging to him cold and clammy.</p>
<p>There is no need to tell you much of his adventures that night, for now we
are drawing near the end of the eastward journey and coming to the last and
greatest adventure, so we must hurry on. Of course helped by his magic ring he
got on very well at first, but he was given away in the end by his wet footsteps
and the trail of drippings that he left wherever he went or sat; and also he
began to snivel, and wherever he tried to hide he was found out by the terrific
explosions of his suppressed sneezes. Very soon there was a fine commotion in
the village by the riverside; but Bilbo escaped into the woods carrying a loaf
and a leather bottle of wine and a pie that did not belong to him. The rest of
the night he had to pass wet as he was and far from a fire, but the bottle
helped him to do that, and he actually dozed a little on some dry leaves, even
though the year was getting late and the air was chilly.</p>
<p>He woke again with a specially loud sneeze. It was already grey morning, and
there was a merry racket down by the river. They were making up a raft of
barrels, and the raft-elves would soon be steering it off down the stream to
Lake-town. Bilbo sneezed again. He was no longer dripping but he felt cold all
over. He scrambled down as fast as his stiff legs would take him and managed
just in time to get on to the mass of casks without being noticed in the general
bustle. Luckily there was no sun at the time to cast an awkward shadow, and for
a mercy he did not sneeze again for a good while.</p>
<p>There was a mighty pushing of poles. The elves that were standing in the
shallow .water heaved and shoved. The barrels now all lashed together creaked
and fretted. .</p>
<p>"This is a heavy load!" some grumbled. "They float too
deep-some of these are never empty. If they had come ashore in the daylight, we
might have had a look inside," they said.</p>
<p>"No time now!" cried the raftman. "Shove off!"</p>
<p>And off they went at last, slowly at first, until they had passed the point
of rock where other elves stood to fend them off with poles, and then quicker
and quicker as they caught the main stream and went sailing away down, down
towards the Lake.</p>
<p>They had escaped the dungeons of the king and were through the wood, but
whether alive or dead still remains to be seen.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<h2>A Warm Welcome</h2>
<p>The day grew lighter and warmer as they floated along. After a while the
river rounded a steep shoulder of land that came down upon their left. Under its
rocky feet like an inland cliff the deepest stream had flowed lapping and
bubbling. Suddenly the cliff fell away. The shores sank. The trees ended. Then
Bilbo saw a sight: The lands opened wide about him, filled with the waters of
the river which broke up and wandered in a hundred winding courses, or halted in
marshes and pools dotted with isles on every side: but still a strong water
flowed on steadily through the midst. And far away, its dark head in a torn
cloud, there loomed the Mountain! Its nearest neighbours to the North-East and
the tumbled land that joined it to them could not be seen. All alone it rose and
looked across the marshes to the forest. The Lonely Mountain! Bilbo had come far
and through many adventures to see it, and now he did not like the look of it in
the least.</p>
<p>As he listened to the talk of the raftmen and pieced together the scraps of
information they let fall, he soon realized that he was very fortunate ever to
have seen it at all, even from this distance. Dreary as had been his
imprisonment and unpleasant as was his position (to say nothing of the poor
dwarves underneath him) still, he had been more lucky than he had guessed. The
talk was all of the trade that came and went on the waterways and the growth of
the traffic on the river, as the roads out of the East towards Mirkwood vanished
or fell into disuse; and of the bickerings of the Lake-men and the Wood-elves
about the upkeep of the Forest River and the care of the banks.</p>
<p>Those lands had changed much since the days when dwarves dwelt in the
Mountain, days which most people now remembered only as a very shadowy
tradition. They had changed even in recent years, and since the last news that
Gandalf had had of them. Great floods and rains had swollen the waters that
flowed east; and there had been an earthquake or two (which some were inclined
to attribute to the dragon-alluding to him chiefly with a curse and an ominous
nod in the direction of the Mountain). The marshes and bogs had spread wider and
wider on either side. Paths had vanished, and many a rider and wanderer too, if
they had tried to find the lost ways across. The elf-road through the wood which
the dwarves had followed on the advice of Beorn now came to a doubtful and
little used end at the eastern edge of the forest; only the river offered any
longer a safe way from the skirts of Mirkwood in the North to the
mountain-shadowed plains beyond, and the river was guarded by the Wood-elves'
king.</p>
<p>So you see Bilbo had come in the end by the only road that was any good. It
might have been some comfort to Mr. Baggins shivering on the barrels, if he had
known that news of this had reached Gandalf far away and given him great
anxiety, and that he was in fact finishing his other business (which does not
come into this tale) and getting ready to come in search of Thorin's company.
But Bilbo did not know it.</p>
<p>All he knew was that the river seemed to go on and on and on for ever, and he
was hungry, and had a nasty cold in the nose, and did not like the way the
Mountain seemed to frown at him and threaten him as it drew ever nearer. After a
while, however, the river took a more southerly course and the Mountain receded
again, and at last, late in the day the shores grew rocky, the river gathered
all its wandering waters together into a deep and rapid flood, and they swept
along at great speed.</p>
<p>The sun had set when turning with another sweep towards the East the
forest-river rushed into the Long Lake. There it had a wide mouth with stony
clifflike gates at either side whose feet were piled with shingles. The Long
Lake! Bilbo had never imagined that any water that was not the sea could look so
big. It was so wide that the opposite shores looked small and far, but it was so
long that its northerly end, which pointed towards the Mountain, could not be
seen at all. Only from the map did Bilbo know that away up there, where the
stars of the Wain were already twinkling, the Running River came down into the
lake from Dale and with the Forest River filled with deep waters what must once
have been a great deep rocky valley. At the southern end the doubled waters
poured out again over high waterfalls and ran away hurriedly to unknown lands.
In the still evening air the noise of the falls could be heard like a distant
roar.</p>
<p>Not far from the mouth of the Forest River was the strange town he heard the
elves speak of in the king's cellars. It was not built on the shore, though
there were a few huts and buildings there, but right out on the surface of the
lake, protected from the swirl of the entering river by a promontory of rock
which formed a calm bay. A great . bridge made of wood ran out to where on huge
piles made of forest trees was built a busy wooden town, not a town of elves but
of Men, who still dared to dwell here under the shadow of the distant
dragon-mountain. They still throve on the trade that came up the great river
from the South and was carted past the falls to their town; but in the great
days of old, when Dale in the North was rich and prosperous, they had been
wealthy and powerful, and there had been fleets of boats on the waters, and some
were filled with gold and some with warriors in armour, and there had been wars
and deeds which were now only a legend. The rotting piles of a greater town
could still be seen along the shores when the waters sank in a drought.</p>
<p>But men remembered little of all that, though some still sang old songs of
the dwarf-kings of the Mountain, Thror and Thrain of the race of Durin, and of
the coming of the Dragon, and the fall of the lords of Dale. Some sang too that
Thror and Thrain would come back one day and gold would flow in rivers through
the mountain-gates, and all that land would be filled with new song and new
laughter. But this pleasant legend did not much affect their daily business.</p>
<p>As soon as the raft of barrels came in sight boats rowed out from the piles
of the town, and voices hailed the raft-steerers. Then ropes were cast and oars
were pulled, and soon the raft was drawn out of the current of the Forest River
and towed away round the high shoulder of rock into the little bay of Lake-town.
There it was moored not far from the shoreward head of the great bridge. Soon
men would come up from the South and take some of the casks away, and others
they would fill with goods they had brought to be taken back up the stream to
the Wood-elves' home. In the meanwhile the barrels were left afloat while the
elves of the raft and the boatmen went to feast in Lake-town.</p>
<p>They would have been surprised, if they could have seen what happened down by
the shore, after they had gone and the shades of night had fallen. First of all
a barrel was cut loose by Bilbo and pushed to the shore and opened. Groans came
from inside, and out crept a most unhappy dwarf. Wet straw was in his draggled
beard; he was so sore and stiff, so bruised and buffeted he could hardly stand
or stumble through the shallow water to lie groaning on the shore. He had a
famished and a savage look like a dog that has been chained and forgotten in a
kennel for a week. It was Thorin, but you could only have told it by his golden
chain, and by the colour of his now dirty and tattered sky-blue hood with its
tarnished silver tassel. It was some time before he would be even polite to the
hobbit.</p>
<p>"Well, are you alive or are you dead?" asked Bilbo quite crossly.
Perhaps he had forgotten that he had had at least one good meal more than the
dwarves, and also the use of his arms and legs, not to speak of a greater
allowance of air. "Are you still in prison, or are you free? If you want
food, and if you want to go on with this silly adventure- it's yours after all
and not mine-you had better slap your arms and rub your legs and try and help me
get the others out while there is a chance!"</p>
<p>Thorin of course saw the sense of this, so after a few more groans he got up
and helped the hobbit as well as he could. In the darkness floundering in the
cold water they had a difficult and very nasty job finding which were the right
barrels. Knocking outside and calling only discovered about six dwarves that
could answer. They were unpacked and helped ashore where they sat or lay
muttering and moaning; they were so soaked and bruised and cramped that they
could hardly yet realize their release or be properly thankful for it.</p>
<p>Dwalin and Balin were two of the most unhappy, and it was no good asking them
to help. Bifur and Bofur were less knocked about and drier, but they lay down
and would do nothing. Fili and Kili, however, who were young (for dwarves) and
had also been packed more neatly with plenty of straw into smaller casks, came
out more or less smiling, with only a bruise or two and a stiffness that soon
wore off.</p>
<p>"I hope I never smell the smell of apples again!" said Fili.
"My tub was full of it. To smell apples everlastingly when you can scarcely
move and are cold and sick with hunger is maddening. I could eat anything in the
wide world now, for hours on end-but not an apple!"</p>
<p>With the willing help of Fili and Kili, Thorin and Bilbo at last discovered
the remainder of the company and got them out. Poor fat Bombur was asleep or
senseless; Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin and Gloin were waterlogged and seemed only half
alive; they all had to be carried one by one and laid helpless on the shore.</p>
<p>"Well! Here we are!" said Thorin. "And I suppose we ought to
thank our stars and Mr. Baggins. I am sure he has a right to expect it, though I
wish he could have arranged a more comfortable journey. Still-all very much at
your service once more, Mr. Baggins. No doubt we shall feel properly grateful,
when we are fed and recovered. In the meanwhile what next?"</p>
<p>"I suggest Lake-town," said Bilbo, "What else is there?"
Nothing else could, of course, be suggested; so leaving the others Thorin and
Fili and Kili and the hobbit went along the shore to the great bridge. There
were guards at the head of it, but they were not keeping very careful watch, for
it was so long since there had been any real need. Except for occasional
squabbles about river-tolls they were friends with the Wood-elves. Other folk
were far away; and some of the younger people in the town openly doubted the
existence of any dragon in the mountain, and laughed at the greybeards and
gammers who said that they had seen him flying in the sky in their young days.
That being so it is not surprising that the guards were drinking and laughing by
a fire in their hut, and did not hear the noise of the unpacking of the dwarves
or the footsteps of the four scouts. Their astonishment was enormous when Thorin
Oakenshield stepped in through the door.</p>
<p>"Who are you and what do you want?" they shouted leaping to their
feet and gipping for weapons.</p>
<p>"Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King under the Mountain!" said
the dwarf in a loud voice, and he looked it, in spite of his torn clothes and
draggled hood. The gold gleamed on his neck and waist: his eyes were dark and
deep. "I have come back. I wish to see the Master of your town!"</p>
<p>Then there was tremendous excitement. Some of the more foolish ran out of the
hut as if they expected the Mountain to go golden in the night and all the
waters of the lake to turn yellow right away. The captain of the guard came
forward.</p>
<p>"And who are these?" he asked, pointing to Fili and: Kili and
Bilbo.</p>
<p>"The sons of my father's daughter," answered Thorin, "Fili and
Kili of the race of Durin, and Mr. Baggins who has travelled with us out of the
West."</p>
<p>"If you come in peace lay down your arms!" said the captain.</p>
<p>"We have none," said Thorin, and it was true enough: their knives
had been taken from them by the wood-elves, and the great sword Orcrist too.
Bilbo had his short sword, hidden as usual, but he said nothing about that.
"We have no need of weapons, who return at last to our own as spoken of
old. Nor could we fight against so many. Take us to your master!"</p>
<p>"He is at feast," said the captain.</p>
<p>"Then all the more reason for taking us to him," burst in Fili, who
was getting impatient at these solemnities. "We are worn and famished after
our long road and we have sick comrades. Now make haste and let us have no more
words, or your master may have something to say to you."</p>
<p>"Follow me then," said the captain, and with six men about them he
led them over the bridge through the gates and into the market-place of the
town. This was a wide circle of quiet water surrounded by the tall piles on
which were built the greater houses, and by long wooden quays with many steps
and ladders going down to the surface of the lake. From one great hall shone
many lights and there came the sound of many voices. They passed its doors and
stood blinking in the light looking at long tables filled with folk.</p>
<p>"I am Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King under the Mountain! I
return!" cried Thorin in a loud voice from the door, before the captain
could say anything. All leaped to their feet. The Master of the town sprang from
his great chair. But none rose in greater surprise than the raft-men of the
elves who were sitting at the lower end of the hall. Pressing forward before the
Master's table they cried:</p>
<p>"These are prisoners of our king that have escaped, wandering vagabond
dwarves that could not give any good account of themselves, sneaking through the
woods and molesting our people!"</p>
<p>"Is this true?" asked the Master. As a matter of fact he thought it
far more likely than the return of the King under the Mountain, if any such
person had ever existed.</p>
<p>"It is true that we were wrongfully waylaid by the Elven-king and
imprisoned without cause as we journeyed back to our own land," answered
Thorin. "But lock nor bar may hinder the homecoming spoken of old. Nor is
this town in the Wood-elves' realm. I speak to the Master of the town of the Men
of the lake, not to the raft-men of the king."</p>
<p>Then the Master hesitated and looked from one to the other. The Elvenking was
very powerful in those parts and the Master wished for no enmity with him, nor
did he think much of old songs, giving his mind to .trade and tolls, to cargoes
and gold, to which habit he owed his position. Others were of different mind,
however, and quickly the matter was settled without him. The news had spread
from the doors of the hall like fire through all the town. People were shouting
inside the hall and outside it. The quays were thronged with hurrying feet. Some
began to sing snatches of old songs concerning the return of the King under the
Mountain; that it was Thror's grandson not Thror himself that had come back did
not bother them at all. Others took up the song and it rolled loud and high over
the lake.</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The King beneath the mountains,</p>
<p>The King of carven stone,</p>
<p>The lord of silver fountains</p>
<p>Shall come into his own!</p>
<p>His crown shall be upholden,</p>
<p>His harp shall be restrung,</p>
<p>His halls shall echo golden</p>
<p>To songs of yore re-sung.</p>
<p>The woods shall wave on mountains</p>
<p>And grass beneath the sun;</p>
<p>His wealth shall flow in fountains</p>
<p>And the rivers golden run.</p>
<p>The streams shall run in gladness,</p>
<p>The lakes shall shine and burn,</p>
<p>And sorrow fail and sadness</p>
<p>At the Mountain-king's return!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>So they sang, or very like that, only there was a great deal more of it, and
there was much shouting as well as the music of harps and of fiddles mixed up
with it. Indeed such excitement had not been known in the town in the memory of
the oldest grandfather. The Wood-elves themselves began to wonder greatly and
even to be afraid. They did not know of course how Thorin had escaped, and they
began to think their king might have made a serious mistake. As for the Master
he saw there was nothing else for it but to obey the general clamour, for the
moment at any rate, and to pretend to believe that Thorin was what he said. So
he gave up to him his own great chair and set Fili and Kili beside him in places
of honour. Even Bilbo was given a seat at the high table, and no explanation of
where he came in-no songs had alluded to him even in the obscurest way-was asked
for in the general bustle.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards the other dwarves were brought into the town amid scenes of
astonishing enthusiasm. They were all doctored and fed and housed and pampered
in the most delightful and satisfactory fashion. A large house was given up to
Thorin and his company; boats and rowers were put at their service; and crowds
sat outside and sang songs all day, or cheered if any dwarf showed so much as
his nose.</p>
<p>Some of the songs were old ones; but some of them were quite new and spoke
confidently of the sudden death of the dragon and of cargoes of rich presents
coming down the river to Lake-town. These were inspired largely by the Master
and they did not particularly please the dwarves, but in the meantime they were
well contented and they quickly grew fat and strong again. Indeed within a week
they were quite recovered, fitted out in fine cloth of their proper colours,
with beards combed and trimmed, and proud steps. Thorin looked and walked as if
his kingdom was already regained and Smaug chopped up into little pieces.</p>
<p>Then, as he had said, the dwarves' good feeling towards the little hobbit
grew stronger every day. There were no more groans or grumbles. They drank his
health, and they patted him on the back, and they made a great fuss of him;
which was just as well, for he was not feeling particularly cheerful. He had not
forgotten the look of the Mountain, nor the thought of the dragon, and he had
besides a shocking cold. For three days he sneezed and coughed, and he could not
go out, and even after that his speeches at banquets were limited to "Thag
you very buch."</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the Wood-elves had gone back up the Forest River with their
cargoes, and there was great excitement in the king's palace. I have never heard
what happened to the chief of the guards and the butler. Nothing of course was
ever said about keys or barrels while the dwarves stayed in Lake-town, and Bilbo
was careful never to become invisible. Still, I daresay, more was guessed than
was known, though doubtless Mr. Baggins remained a bit of a mystery. In any case
the king knew now the dwarves' errand, or thought he did, and he said to
himself:</p>
<p>"Very well! We'll see! No treasure will come back through Mirkwood
without my having something to say in the matter. But I expect they will all
come to a bad end, and serve them right!" He at any rate did not believe in
dwarves fighting and killing dragons like Smaug, and he strongly suspected
attempted burglary or something like it which shows he was a wise elf and wiser
than the men of the town, though not quite right, as we shall see in the end. He
sent out his spies about the shores of the lake and as far northward towards the
Mountains as they would go, and waited.</p>
<p>At the end of a fortnight Thorin began to think of departure. While the
enthusiasm still lasted in the town was the time to get help. It would not do to
let everything cool down with delay. So he spoke to the Master and his
councillors and said that soon he and his company must go on towards the
Mountain.</p>
<p>Then for the first time the Master was surprised and a little frightened; and
he wondered if Thorin was after all really a descendant of the old kings. He had
never thought that the dwarves would actually dare to approach Smaug, but
believed they were frauds who would sooner or later be discovered and be turned
out. He was wrong. Thorin, of course, was really the grandson of the King under
the Mountain, and there is no knowing what a dwarf will not dare and do for
revenge or the recovery of his own. But the Master was not sorry at all to let
them go. They were expensive to keep, and their arrival had turned things into a
long holiday in which business was at a standstill.</p>
<p>"Let them go and bother Smaug, and see how he welcomes them!" he
thought. "Certainly, O Thorin Thrain's son Thror's son!" was what he
said. "You must claim your own. The hour is at hand, spoken of old. What
help we can offer shall be yours, and we trust to your gratitude when your
kingdom is regained."</p>
<p>So one day, although autumn was now getting far on, and winds were cold, and
leaves were falling fast, three large boats left Lake-town, laden with rowers,
dwarves, Mr. Baggins, and many provisions. Horses and ponies had been sent round
by circuitous paths to meet them at their appointed landing-place. The Master
and his councillors bade them farewell from the great steps of the town-hall
that went down to the lake. People sang on the quays and out of windows. The
white oars dipped and splashed, and off they went north up the lake on the last
stage of their long journey. The only person thoroughly unhappy was Bilbo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="11"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<h2>On the Doorstep</h2>
<p>In two days going they rowed right up the Long Lake and passed out into the
River Running, and now they could all see the Lonely Mountain towering grim and
tall before them. The stream was strong and their going slow. At the; end of the
third day, some miles up the river, they drew in to the left or western bank and
disembarked. Here they were joined by the horses with other provisions and
necessaries and the ponies for their own use that had been sent to meet them.
They packed what they could on the ponies and the rest was made into a store
under a tent, but none of the men of the town would stay with them even for the
night so near the shadow of the Mountain.</p>
<p>"Not at any rate until the songs have come true!" said they. It was
easier to believe in the Dragon and less easy to believe in Thorin in these wild
parts. Indeed their stores had no need of any guard, for all the land was
desolate and empty. So their escort left them, making off swiftly down the river
and the shoreward paths, although the night was already drawing on.</p>
<p>They spent a cold and lonely night and their spirits fell. The next day they
set out again. Balin and Bilbo rode behind, each leading another pony heavily
laden beside him; the others were some way ahead picking out a slow road, for
there were no paths. They made north-west, slanting away from the River Running,
and drawing ever nearer and nearer to a great spur of the Mountain that was
flung out southwards towards them.</p>
<p>It was a weary journey, and a quiet and stealthy one. There was no laughter
or song or sound of harps, and the pride and hopes which had stirred in their
hearts at the singing of old songs by the lake died away to a plodding gloom.
They knew that they were drawing near to the end of their journey, and that it
might be a very horrible end. The land about them grew bleak and barren, though
once, as Thorin told them, it had been green and fair. There was little grass,
and before long there was neither bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened
stumps to speak of ones long vanished. They were come to the Desolation of the
Dragon, and they were come at the waning of the year.</p>
<p>They reached the skirts of the Mountain all the same without meeting any
danger or any sign of the Dragon other than the wilderness he had made about his
lair. The Mountain lay dark and silent before them and ever higher above them.
They made their first camp on the western side of the great southern spur, which
ended in a height called Ravenhill. On this there had been an old watch-post;
but they dared not climb it yet, it was too exposed.</p>
<p>Before setting out to search the western spurs of the Mountain for the hidden
door, on which all their hopes rested, Thorin sent out a scouting expedition to
spy out the land to the South where the Front Gate stood. For this purpose he
chose Balin and Fili and Kili, and with them went Bilbo. They marched under the
grey and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill. There the river, after winding
a wide loop over the valley of Dale, turned from the Mountain on its road to the
Lake, flowing swift and noisily. Its bank was bare and rocky, tall and steep
above the stream; and gazing out from it over the narrow water, foaming and
splashing among many boulders, they could see in the wide valley shadowed by the
Mountain's arms the grey ruins of ancient houses, towers, and walls.</p>
<p>"There lies all that is left of Dale," said Balin. "The
mountain's sides were green with woods and all the sheltered valley rich and
pleasant in the days when the bells rang in that town." He looked both sad
and grim as he said this: he had been one of Thorin's companions on the day the
Dragon came.</p>
<p>They did not dare to follow the river much further to. wards the Gate; but
they went on beyond the end of the southern spur, until lying hidden behind a
rock they could look out and see the dark cavernous opening in a great
cliff-wall between the arms of the Mountain. Out of it the waters of the Running
River sprang; and out of it too there came a steam and a dark smoke. Nothing
moved in the waste, save the vapour and the water, and every now and again a
black and ominous crow. The only sound was the sound of the stony water, and
every now and again the harsh croak of a bird. Balin shuddered.</p>
<p>"Let us return!" he said. "We can do no good here!- And I
don't like these dark birds, they look like spies of evil."</p>
<p>"The dragon is still alive and in the halls under the Mountain then-or I
imagine so from the smoke," said the hobbit.</p>
<p>"That does not prove it," said Balin, "though I don't doubt
you are right. But he might be gone away some time, or he might be lying out on
the mountain-side keeping watch, and still I expect smokes and steams would come
out of the gates: all the halls within must be filled with his foul reek."</p>
<p>With such gloomy thoughts, followed ever by croaking crows above them, they
made their weary way back to the camp. Only in June they had been guests in the
fair house of Elrond, and though autumn was now crawling towards winter that
pleasant time now seemed years ago. They were alone in the perilous waste
without hope of further help. They were at the end of their journey, but as far
as ever, it seemed, from the end of their quest. None of them had much spirit
left.</p>
<p>Now strange to say Mr. Baggins had more than the others. He would often
borrow Thorin's map and gaze at it, pondering over the runes and the message of
the moon-letters Elrond had read. It was he that made the dwarves begin the
dangerous search on the western slopes for the secret door. They moved their
camp then to a long valley, narrower than the great dale in the South where the
Gates of the river stood, and walled with lower spurs of the Mountain. Two of
these here thrust forward west from the main mass in long steep-sided ridges
that fell ever downwards towards the plain. On this western side there were
fewer signs of the dragon's marauding feet, and there was some grass for their
ponies. From this western camp, shadowed all day by cliff and wall until the sun
began to sink towards the forest, day by day they toiled in parties searching
for paths up the mountain-side. If the map was true, somewhere high above the
cliff at the valley's head must stand the secret door. Day by day they came back
to their camp without success.</p>
<p>But at last unexpectedly they found what they were seeking. Fili and Kili and
the hobbit went back one day down the valley and scrambled among the tumbled
rocks at its southern corner. About midday, creeping behind a great stone that
stood alone like a pillar, Bilbo came on what looked like rough steps going
upwards. Following these excitedly he and the dwarves found traces of a narrow
track, often lost, often rediscovered, that wandered on to the top of the
southern ridge and brought them at last to a still narrower ledge, which turned
north across the face of the Mountain. Looking down they saw that they were at
the top of the cliff at the valley's head and were gazing down on to their own
camp below. Silently, clinging to the rocky wall on their right, they went in
single file along the ledge, till the wall opened and they turned into a little
steep-walled bay, grassy-floored, still and quiet. Its entrance which they had
found could not be seen from below because of the overhang of the cliff, nor
from further off because it was so small that it looked like a dark crack and no
more. It was not a cave and was open to the sky above; but at its inner end a
flat wall rose up that in the lower I part, close to the ground, was as smooth
and upright as mason's work, but without a joint or crevice to be seen.</p>
<p>"No sign was there of post or lintel or threshold, nor any sign of bar
or bolt or key-hole; yet they did not doubt that they had found the door at
last.</p>
<p>They beat on it, they thrust and pushed at it, they implored it to move, they
spoke fragments of broken spells of opening, and nothing stirred. At last tired
out they. rested on the grass at its feet, and then at evening began, their long
climb down.</p>
<p>There was excitement in the camp that night. In the morning they prepared to
move once more. Only Bofur and Bombur were left behind to guard the ponies and
such stores as they had brought with them from the river. The others went down
the valley and up the newly found path, and so to the narrow ledge. Along this
they could carry no bundles or packs, so narrow and breathless was it, with a
fall of a hundred and fifty feet beside them on to sharp rocks below; but each
of them took a good coil of rope wound tight about his waist, and so at last
without mishap they reached the little grassy bay.</p>
<p>There they made their third camp, hauling up what they needed from below with
their ropes. Down the same way they were able occasionally to lower one of the
more active dwarves, such as Kili, to exchange such news as there was, or to
take a share in the guard below, while Bofur was hauled up to the higher camp.
Bombur would not come up either the rope or the path.</p>
<p>"I am too fat for such fly-walks," he said. "I should turn
dizzy and tread on my beard, and then you would be thirteen again. And the
knotted ropes are too slender for my weight." Luckily for him that was not
true, as you will see.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile some of them explored the ledge beyond the opening and found
a path that led higher and higher on to the mountain; but they did not dare to
venture very far that way, nor was there much use in it. Out up there a silence
reigned, broken by no bird or sound except that of the wind in the crannies of
stone. They spoke low and never called or sang, for danger brooded in every
rock.</p>
<p>The others who were busy with the secret of the door had no more success.
They were too eager to trouble about the runes or the moon-letters, but tried
without resting to discover where exactly in the smooth face of the rock the
door was hidden. They had brought picks and tools of many sorts from Lake-town,
and at first they tried to use these. But when they struck the stone the handles
splintered and jarred their arms cruelly, and the steel heads broke or bent like
lead. Mining work, they saw clearly was no good against the magic that had shut
this door; and they grew terrified, too, of the echoing noise.</p>
<p>Bilbo found sitting on the doorstep lonesome and wearisome-there was not a
doorstep, of course, really, but they used to call the little grassy space
between the wall and the opening the "doorstep" in fun, remembering
Bilbo's words long ago at the unexpected party in his hobbit-hole, when he said
they could sit on the doorstep till they thought of something. And sit and think
they did, or wandered aimlessly about, and glummer and glummer they became.</p>
<p>Their spirits had risen a little at the discovery of the path, but now they
sank into their boots; and yet they would not give it up and go away. The hobbit
was no longer much brighter than the dwarves. He would do nothing but sit with
his back to the rock-face and stare away west through the opening, over the
cliff, over the wide lands to the black wall of Mirkwood, and to the distances
beyond, in which he sometimes thought he could catch glimpses of the Misty
Mountains small and far. If the dwarves asked him what he was doing he answered:</p>
<p>"You said sitting on the doorstep and thinking would be my job, not to
mention getting inside, so I am sitting and thinking." But I am afraid he
was not thinking much of the job, but of what lay beyond the blue distance, the
quiet Western Land and the Hill and his hobbit-hole under it. A large grey stone
lay in the centre of the grass and he stared moodily at it or watched the great
snails. They seemed to love the little shut-in bay with its walls of cool rock,
and there were many of them of huge size crawling slowly and stickily along its
sides.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow begins the last week of Autumn," said Thorin one day.</p>
<p>"And winter comes after autumn," said Bifur.</p>
<p>"And next year after that," said Dwalin, "and our beards will
grow till they hang down the cliff to the valley before anything happens here.
What is our burglar doing for us?</p>
<p>Since he has got an invisible ring, and ought to be a specially excellent
performer now, I am beginning to think he might go through the Front Gate and
spy things out a bit!"</p>
<p>Bilbo heard this-the dwarves were on the rocks just : above the enclosure
where he was sitting-and "Good Gracious!" he thought, "so that is
what they are beginning to think, is it? It is always poor me that has to get
them out : of their difficulties, at least since the wizard left. Whatever am I
going to do? I might have known that something dreadful would happen to me in
the end. I don't think I could bear to see the unhappy valley of Dale again, and
as for that steaming gate! ! !"</p>
<p>That night he was very miserable and hardly slept. Next day the dwarves all
went wandering off in various directions; some were exercising the ponies down
below, some were roving about the mountain-side. All day Bilbo sat gloomily in
the grassy bay gazing at the stone, or out west through the narrow opening. He
had a queer feeling that he was waiting for something. "Perhaps the wizard
will suddenly come back today," he thought.</p>
<p>If he lifted his head he could see a glimpse of the distant forest. As the
sun turned west there was a gleam of yellow upon its far roof, as if the light
caught the last pale leaves. Soon he saw the orange ball of the sun sinking
towards the level of his eyes. He went to the opening and there pale and faint
was a thin new moon above the rim of Earth. At that very moment he heard a sharp
crack behind him. There on the grey stone in the grass was an enormous thrush,
nearly coal black, its pale yellow breast freckled dark spots. Crack! It had
caught a snail and was knocking it on the stone. Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>Suddenly Bilbo understood. Forgetting all danger he stood on the ledge and
hailed the dwarves, shouting and paying. Those that were nearest came tumbling
over the rocks and as fast as they could along the ledge to him, wondering what
on earth was the matter; the others shouted to be hauled up the ropes (except
Bombur, of course: he was asleep).</p>
<p>Quickly Bilbo explained. They all fell silent: the hobbit standing by the
grey stone, and the dwarves with wagging beards watching impatiently. The sun
sank lower and lower, and their hopes fell. It sank into a belt of reddened
cloud and disappeared. The dwarves groaned, but still Bilbo stood almost without
moving. The little moon was dipping to the horizon. Evening was coming on. Then
suddenly when their hope was lowest a red ray of the sun escaped like a finger
through a rent in the cloud. A gleam of light came straight through the opening
into the bay and fell on the smooth rock-face. The old thrush, who had been
watching from a high perch with beady eyes and head cocked on one side, gave a
sudden trill. There was a loud attack. A flake of rock split from the wall and
fell. A hole appeared suddenly about three feet from the ground. Quickly,
trembling lest the chance should fade, the dwarves rushed to the rock and
pushed-in vain.</p>
<p>"The key! The key!" cried Bilbo. "Where is Thorin?"</p>
<p>Thorin hurried up.</p>
<p>"The key!" shouted Bilbo. "The key that went with the map! Try
it now while there is still time!"</p>
<p>Then Thorin stepped up and drew the key on its chain from round his neck. He
put it to the hole. It fitted and it turned! Snap! The gleam went out, the sun
sank, the moon was gone, and evening sprang into the sky.</p>
<p>Now they all pushed together, and slowly a part of the rock-wall gave way.
Long straight cracks appeared and widened. A door five feet high and three broad
was out- lined, and slowly without a sound swung inwards. It seemed as if
darkness flowed out like a vapour from the hole in the mountain-side, and deep
darkness in which nothing could be seen lay before their eyes mouth leading in
and down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="12"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<h2>Inside Information</h2>
<p>For a long time the dwarves stood in the dark before the door and debated,
until at last Thorin spoke:</p>
<p>"Now is the time for our esteemed Mr. Baggins, who has proved himself a
good companion on our long road, and a hobbit full of courage and resource far
exceeding his size, and if I may say so possessed of good luck far exceeding the
usual allowance-now is the time for him to perform the service for which he was
included in our Company; now is the time for him to earn his Reward."</p>
<p>You are familiar with Thorin's style on important occasions, so I will not
give you any more of it, though he went on a good deal longer than this. It
certainly was an important occasion, but Bilbo felt impatient. By now he was
quite familiar with Thorin too, and he knew what be was driving at.</p>
<p>"If you mean you think it is my job to go into the secret passage first,
O Thorin Thrain's son Oakenshield, may your beard grow ever longer," he
said crossly, "say so at once and have done! I might refuse. I have got you
out of two messes already, which were hardly in the original bargain, so that I
am, I think, already owed some reward. But ‘third time pays for all' as my
father used to say, and somehow I don't think I shall refuse. Perhaps I have
begun to trust my luck more than I used to in the old days" - he meant last
spring before he left his own house, but it seemed centuries ago - "but
anyway I think I will go and have a peep at once and get it over. Now who is
coming with me?"</p>
<p>He did not expect a chorus of volunteers, so he was not disappointed. Fili
and Kili looked uncomfortable and stood on One leg, but the others made no
pretence of offering - except old Balin. the look-out man, who was rather fond
the hobbit. He said he would come inside at least and perhaps a bit of the way
too, really to call for help if necessary.</p>
<p>The most that can be said for the dwarves is this: they intended to pay Bilbo
really handsomely for his services; they had brought him to do a nasty job for
them, and they did not mind the poor little fellow doing it if he would; but
they would all have done their best to get him out of trouble, if he got into
it, as they did in the case of the trolls at the beginning of their adventures
before they had any particular reasons for being grateful to him. There it is:
dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk with a great idea of the value of
money; some are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots; some are not, but
are decent enough people like Thorin and Company, if you don't expect too much.</p>
<p>The stars were coming out behind him in a pale sky barred with black when the
hobbit crept through the enchanted door and stole into the Mountain. It was far
easier going than he expected. This was no goblin entrance, or rough wood-elves'
cave. It was a passage made by dwarves, at the height of their wealth and skill:
straight as a ruler, smooth-floored and smooth-sided, going with a gentle
never-varying slope direct-to some distant end in the blackness below.</p>
<p>After a while Balin bade Bilbo "Good luck!" and stopped where he
could still see the faint outline of the door, and by a trick of, the echoes of
the tunnel hear the rustle of the whispering voices of the others just outside.
Then the hobbit slipped on his ring, and warned by the echoes to take more than
hobbit's care to make no sound, he crept noiselessly down, down, down into the
dark. He was trembling with fear, but his little face was set and grim. Already
he was a very different hobbit from the one that had run out without a
pocket-handkerchief from Bag-End long ago. He had not had a pocket-handkerchief
for ages. He loosened his dagger in its sheath, tightened his belt, and went on.</p>
<p>"Now you are in for it at last, Bilbo Baggins," he said to himself.
"You went and put your foot right in it that night of the party, and now
you have got to pull it out and pay for it! Dear me, what a fool I was and
am!" said the least Tookish part of him. "I have absolutely no use for
dragon-guarded treasures, and the whole lot could stay here for ever, if only I
could wake up and find this beastly tunnel was my own front-hall at home!"</p>
<p>He did not wake up of course, but went still on and on, till all sign of the
door behind had faded away. He was altogether alone. Soon he thought it was
beginning to feel warm. "Is that a kind of a glow I seem to see coming
right ahead down there?" he thought. It was. As he went forward it grew and
grew, till there was no doubt about it. It was a red light steadily getting
redder and redder. Also it was now undoubtedly hot in the tunnel. Wisps of
vapour floated up and past him and he began to sweat. A sound, too, began to
throb in his ears, a sort of bubbling like the noise of a large pot galloping on
the fire, mixed with a rumble as of a gigantic tom-cat purring. This grew to the
unmistakable gurgling noise of some vast animal snoring in its sleep down there
in the red glow in front of him.</p>
<p>It was at this point that Bilbo stopped. Going on from there was the bravest
thing he ever did. The tremendous things that happened afterward were as nothing
compared to it. He fought the real battle in the tunnel alone, before he ever
saw the vast danger that lay in wait. At any rate after a short halt go on he
did; and you can picture him coming to the end of the tunnel, an opening of much
the same size and shape as the door above. Through it peeps the hobbit's little
head. Before him lies the great bottommost cellar or dungeon-hall of the ancient
dwarves right at the Mountain's root. It is almost dark so that its vastness can
only be dimly guessed, but rising from the near side of the rocky floor there is
a great glow. The glow of Smaug!</p>
<p>There he lay, a vast red-golden dragon, fast asleep; thrumming came from his
jaws and nostrils, and wisps of smoke, but his fires were low in slumber.
Beneath him, under all his limbs and his huge coiled tail, and about him on all
sides stretching away across the unseen floors, lay countless piles of precious
things, gold wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and silver red-stained in
the ruddy light.</p>
<p>Smaug lay, with wings folded like an immeasurable bat, turned partly on one
side, so that the hobbit could see his underparts and his long pale belly
crusted with gems and fragments of gold from his long lying on his costly bed.
Behind him where the walls were nearest could dimly be seen coats of mail, helms
and axes, swords and spears hanging; and there in rows stood great jars and
vessels filled with a wealth that could not be guessed. To say that Bilbo's
breath was taken away is no description at all. There are no words left to
express his staggerment, since Men changed the language that they learned of
elves in the days when all the world was wonderful. Bilbo had heard tell and
sing of dragon-hoards before, but the splendour, the lust, the glory of such
treasure had never yet come home to him. His heart was filled and pierced with
enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; and he gazed motionless, almost
forgetting the frightful guardian, at the gold beyond price and count.</p>
<p>He gazed for what seemed an age, before drawn almost against his will, he
stole from the shadow of the doorway, across the floor to the nearest edge of
the mounds of treasure. Above him the sleeping dragon lay, a dire menace even in
his sleep. He grasped a great two-handled cup, as heavy as he could carry, and
cast one fearful eye upwards. Smaug stirred a wing, opened a claw, the rumble of
his snoring changed its note.</p>
<p>Then Bilbo fled. But the dragon did not wake - not - yet but shifted into
other dreams of greed and violence, lying there in his stolen hall while the
little hobbit toiled back up the long tunnel. His heart was beating and a more
fevered shaking was in his legs than when he was going down, but still he
clutched the cup, and his chief thought was: "I've done it! This will show
them. 'More like a grocer than a burglar' indeed! Well, we'll hear no more of
that."</p>
<p>Nor did he. Balin was overjoyed to see the hobbit again, and as delighted as
he was surprised. He picked Bilbo up and carried him out into the open air. It
was midnight and clouds had covered the stars, but Bilbo lay with his eyes shut,
gasping and taking pleasure in the feel of the fresh air again, and hardly
noticing the excitement of the dwarves, or how they praised him and patted him
on the back and put themselves and all their families for generations to come at
his service.</p>
<p>The dwarves were still passing the cup from hand to hand and talking
delightedly of the recovery of their treasure, when suddenly a vast rumbling
woke in the mountain underneath as if it was an old volcano that had made up its
mind to start eruptions once again. The door behind them was pulled nearly to,
and blocked from closing with a stone, but up the long tunnel came the dreadful
echoes, from far down in the depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that made
the ground beneath them tremble.</p>
<p>Then the dwarves forgot their joy and their confident boasts of a moment
before and cowered down in fright. Smaug was still to be reckoned with. It does
not do to leave a live dragon out of your calculations, if you live near him.
Dragons may not have much real use for all their wealth, but they know it to an
ounce as a rule, especially after long possession; and Smaug was no exception.
He had passed from an uneasy dream (in which a warrior, altogether insignificant
in size but provided with a bitter sword and great courage, figured most
unpleasantly) to a doze, and from a doze to wide waking. There was a breath of
strange air in his cave. Could there be a draught from that little hole? He had
never felt quite happy about it, though was so small, and now he glared at it in
suspicion an wondered why he had never blocked it up. Of late he had half
fancied he had caught the dim echoes of a knocking sound from far above that
came down through it to his lair. He stirred and stretched forth his neck to
sniff. Then he missed the cup!</p>
<p>Thieves! Fire! Murder! Such a thing had not happened since first he came to
the Mountain! His rage passes description - the sort of rage that is only seen
when rich folk that have more than they can enjoy suddenly lose something that
they have long had but have never before used or wanted. His fire belched forth,
the hall smoked, he shook the mountain-roots. He thrust his head in vain at the
little hole, and then coiling his length together, roaring like thunder
underground, he sped from his deep lair through its great door, out into the
huge passages of the mountain-palace and up towards the Front Gate.</p>
<p>To hunt the whole mountain till he had caught the thief and had torn and
trampled him was his one thought. He issued from the Gate, the waters rose in
fierce whistling steam, and up he soared blazing into the air and settled on the
mountain-top in a spout of green and scarlet flame. The dwarves heard the awful
rumour of his flight, and they crouched against the walls of the grassy terrace
cringing under boulders, hoping somehow to escape the frightful eyes of the
hunting dragon.</p>
<p>There they would have all been killed, if it had not been for Bilbo once
again. "Quick! Quick!" he gasped. "The door! The tunnel! It's no
good here."</p>
<p>Roused by these words they were just about to creep inside the tunnel when
Bifur gave a cry: "My cousins! Bombur and Bofur - we have forgotten them,
they are down in the valley!"</p>
<p>"They will be slain, and all our ponies too, and all out stores
lost," moaned the others. "We can do nothing."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" said Thorin, recovering his dignity. "We cannot
leave them. Get inside Mr. Baggins and Balin, and you two Fili and Kili-the
dragon shan't have all of us. Now you others, where are the ropes? Be
quick!"</p>
<p>Those were perhaps the worst moments they had been through yet. The horrible
sounds of Smaug's anger were echoing in the stony hollows far above; at any
moment he might come blazing down or fly whirling round and find them there,
near the perilous cliff's edge hauling madly on the ropes. Up came Bofur, and
still all was safe. Up came Bombur, puffing and blowing while the ropes creaked,
and still all was safe. Up came some tools and bundles of stores, and then
danger was upon them. A whirring noise was heard. A red light touched the points
of standing rocks. The dragon came. They had barely time to fly back to the
tunnel, pulling and dragging in their bundles, when Smaug came hurtling from the
North, licking the mountain-sides with flame, beating his great wings with a
noise like a roaring wind. His hot breath shrivelled the grass before the door,
and drove in through the crack they had left and scorched them as they lay hid.
Flickering fires leaped up and black rock-shadows danced. Then darkness fell as
he passed again.</p>
<p>The ponies screamed with terror, burst their ropes and galloped wildly off.
The dragon swooped and turned to pursue them, and was gone.</p>
<p>"That'll be the end of our poor beasts!" said Thorin.</p>
<p>"Nothing can escape Smaug once he sees it. Here we are and here we shall
have to stay, unless any one fancies tramping the long open miles back to the
river with Smaug on the watch!"</p>
<p>It was not a pleasant thought! They crept further down the tunnel, and there
they lay and shivered though it was warm and stuffy, until dawn came pale
through the crack of the door. Every now and again through the night they could
hear the roar of the flying dragon grow and then pass and fade, as he hunted
round and round the mountain-sides.</p>
<p>He guessed from the ponies, and from the traces of the camps he had
discovered, that men had come up from the river and the lake and had scaled the
mountain-side from the valley where the ponies had been standing; but the door
withstood his searching eye, and the little high-walled bay had kept out his
fiercest flames. Long he had hunted in vain till the dawn chilled his wrath and
he went back to his golden couch to sleep - and to gather new strength.</p>
<p>He would not forget or forgive the theft, not if a thousand years turned him
to smouldering stone, but he could afford to wait. Slow and silent he crept back
to his lair and half closed his eyes.</p>
<p>When morning came the terror of the dwarves grew less. They realized that
dangers of this kind were inevitable in dealing with such a guardian, and that
it was no good giving up their quest yet. Nor could they get away just now, as
Thorin had pointed out. Their ponies were lost or killed, and they would have to
wait some time before Smaug relaxed his watch sufficiently for them to dare the
long way on foot. Luckily they had saved enough of their stores to last them
still for some time.</p>
<p>They debated long on what was to be done, but they could think of no way of
getting rid of Smaug - which had always been a weak point in their plans, as
Bilbo felt inclined to point out. Then as is the nature of folk that are
thoroughly perplexed, they began to grumble at the hobbit, blaming him for what
had at first so pleased them: for bringing away a cup and stirring up Smaug's
wrath so soon.</p>
<p>"What else do you suppose a burglar is to do?" asked Bilbo angrily.
"I was not engaged to kill dragons, that is warrior's work, but to steal
treasure. I made the best beginning I could. Did you expect me to trot back with
the whole hoard of Thror on my back? If there is any grumbling to be done, I
think I might have a say. You ought to have brought five hundred burglars not
one. I am sure it reflects great credit on your grandfather, but you cannot
pretend that you ever made the vast extent of his wealth clear to me. I should
want hundreds of years to bring it all up, if I was fifty times as big, and
Smaug as tame as a rabbit."</p>
<p>After that of course the dwarves begged his pardon.</p>
<p>"What then do you propose we should do, Mr. Baggins?" asked Thorin
politely.</p>
<p>"I have no idea at the moment - if you mean about removing the treasure.
That obviously depends entirely on some new turn of luck and the getting rid of
Smaug.</p>
<p>Getting rid of dragons is not at all in my line, but I will do my best to
think about it. Personally I have no hopes at all, and wish I was safe back at
home."</p>
<p>"Never mind that for the moment! What are we to do now, today?"</p>
<p>"Well, if you really want my advice, I should say we can do nothing but
stay where we are. By day we can no doubt creep out safely enough to take the
air. Perhaps before long one or two could be chosen to go back to the store by
the river and replenish our supplies. But in the meanwhile everyone ought to be
well inside the tunnel by night.</p>
<p>"Now I will make you an offer. I have got my ring and will creep down
this very noon - then if ever Smaug ought to be napping - and see what he is up
to. Perhaps something will turn up. 'Every worm has his weak spot,' as my father
used to say, though I am sure it was not from personal experience."</p>
<p>Naturally the dwarves accepted the offer eagerly. Already they had come to
respect little Bilbo. Now he had become the real leader in their adventure. He
had begun to have ideas and plans of his own. When midday came he got ready for
another journey down into the Mountain. He did not like it of course, but it was
not so bad now he knew, more or less, what was in front of him. Had he known
more about dragons and their wily ways, he might have teen more frightened and
less hopeful of catching this one napping.</p>
<p>The sun was shining when he started, but it was as dark as night in the
tunnel. The light from the door, almost closed, soon faded as he went down. So
silent was his going that smoke on a gentle wind could hardly have surpasses it,
and he was inclined to feel a bit proud of himself as he drew near the lower
door. There was only the very fainter glow to be seen.</p>
<p>"Old Smaug is weary and asleep," he thought. "He can't, see me
and he won't hear me. Cheer up Bilbo!" He had forgotten or had never heard
about dragons' sense of smell.</p>
<p>It is also an awkward fact that they keep half an eye open watching while
they sleep, if they are suspicious. Smaug certainly looked fast asleep, almost
dead and dark, with scarcely a snore more than a whiff of unseen steam, when
Bilbo peeped once more from the entrance. He was just about to step out on to
the floor when he caught a sudden thin and piercing ray of red from under the
drooping lid. of Smaug's left eye. He was only pretending to sleep! He was
watching the tunnel entrance! Hurriedly Bilbo stepped back and blessed the luck
of his ring. Then Smaug spoke.</p>
<p>"Well, thief! I smell you and I feel your air. I hear your breath. Come
along! Help yourself again, there is plenty and to spare!"</p>
<p>But Bilbo was not quite so unlearned in dragon-lore as all that, and if Smaug
hoped to get him to come nearer so easily he was disappointed.</p>
<p>"No thank you, O Smaug the. Tremendous!" he replied. "I did
not come for presents. I only wished to have a look at you and see if you were
truly as great as tales say. I did not believe them."</p>
<p>"Do you now?" said the dragon somewhat flattered, even though he
did not believe a word of it.</p>
<p>"Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of the reality, O Smaug the
Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities," replied Bilbo.</p>
<p>You have nice manners for a thief and a liar," said the dragon.
"You seem familiar with my name, but I don't seem to remember smelling you
before. Who are you and where do you come from, may I ask?"</p>
<p>"You may indeed! I come from under the hill, and under hills and over
the hills my paths led. And through the air, I am he that walks unseen."</p>
<p>"So I can well believe," said Smaug, "but that is hardly our
usual name."</p>
<p>"I am the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the stinging fly. I as chosen for
the lucky number."</p>
<p>"Lovely titles!" sneered the dragon. "But lucky numbers don't
always come off."</p>
<p>"I am he that buries his friends alive and drowns them and draws them
alive again from the water. I came from the end of a bag, but no bag went over
me."</p>
<p>"These don't sound so creditable," scoffed Smaug.</p>
<p>"I am the friend of bears and the guest of eagles. I am Ringwinner and
Luckwearer; and I am Barrel-rider," went on Bilbo beginning to be pleased
with his riddling.</p>
<p>"That's better!" said Smaug. "But don't let your imagination
run away with you!"</p>
<p>This of course is the way to talk to dragons, if you don't want to reveal
your proper name (which is wise), and don't want to infuriate them by a flat
refusal (which is also very wise). No dragon can resist the fascination of
riddling talk and of wasting time trying to understand it. There was a lot here
which Smaug did not understand at all (though I expect you do, since you know
all about Bilbo's adventures to which he was referring), but he thought he
understood enough, and he chuckled in his wicked inside.</p>
<p>"I thought so last night," he smiled to himself. "Lake-men,
some nasty scheme of those miserable tub-trading Lake-men, or I'm a lizard. I
haven't been down that way for an age and an age; but I will soon alter
that!"</p>
<p>"Very well, O Barrel-rider!" he said aloud. "Maybe Barrel was
your pony's name; and maybe not, though it was fat enough. You may walk unseen,
but you did not walk all the way. Let me tell you I ate six ponies last night
and I shall catch and eat all the others before long. In return for the
excellent meal I will give you one piece of advice for your good: don't have
more to do with dwarves than you can help!"</p>
<p>"Dwarves!" said Bilbo in pretended surprise.</p>
<p>"Don't talk to me!" said Smaug. "I know the smell (and taste)
of dwarf-no one better. Don't tell me that I can eat a dwarf-ridden pony and not
know it! You'll come to a bad end, if you go with such friends. Thief
Barrel-rider. I don't mind if you go back and tell them so from me."</p>
<p>But he did not tell Bilbo that there was one smell he could not make out at
all, hobbit-smell; it was quite outside his experience and puzzled him mightily.</p>
<p>"I suppose you got a fair price for that cup last night?" he went
on. "Come now, did you? Nothing at all! Well, that's just like them. And I
suppose they are skulking outside, and your job is to do all the dangerous work
and get what you can when I'm not looking-for them? And you will get a fair
share? Don't you believe it! If you get off alive, you will be lucky."</p>
<p>Bilbo was now beginning to feel really uncomfortable. Whenever Smaug's roving
eye, seeking for him in the shadows, flashed across him, he trembled, and an
unaccountable desire seized hold of him to rush out and reveal himself and tell
all the truth to Smaug. In fact he was in grievous danger of coming under the
dragon-spell. But plucking up courage he spoke again.</p>
<p>"You don't know everything, O Smaug the Mighty," said he. "Not
gold alone brought us hither."</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! You admit the 'us'," laughed Smaug. "Why not say 'us
fourteen' and be done with it. Mr. Lucky Number? I am pleased to hear that you
had other business in these parts besides my gold. In that case you may,
perhaps, not altogether waste your time.</p>
<p>"I don't know if it has occurred to you that, even if you could steal
the gold bit by bit-a matter of a hundred years or so - you could not get it
very far? Not much use on the mountain-side? Not much use in the forest? Bless
me! Had you never thought of the catch? A fourteenth share, I suppose, Or
something like it, those were the terms, eh? But what about delivery? What about
cartage? What about armed guards and tolls?" And Smaug laughed aloud. He
had a wicked and a wily heart, and he knew his guesses were not far out, though
he suspected that the Lake-men were at the back of the plans, and that most of
the plunder was meant to stop there in the town by the shore that in his young
days had been called Esgaroth.</p>
<p>You will hardly believe it, but poor Bilbo was really very taken aback. So
far all his. thoughts and energies had been concentrated on getting to the
Mountain and finding the entrance. He had never bothered to wonder how the
treasure was to be removed, certainly never how any part of it that might fall
to his share was to be brought back all the way to Bag-End Under-Hill.</p>
<p>Now a nasty suspicion began to grow in his mind-had the dwarves forgotten
this important point too, or were they laughing in their sleeves at him all the
time? That is the effect that dragon-talk has on the inexperienced. Bilbo of
course ought to have been on his guard; but Smaug had rather an overwhelming
personality.</p>
<p>"I tell you," he said, in an effort to remain loyal to his friends
and to keep his end up, "that gold was only an afterthought with us. We
came over hill and under hill, by wave and win, for <i>Revenge</i>. Surely, O
Smaug the unassessably wealthy, you must realize that your success has made you
some bitter enemies?"</p>
<p>Then Smaug really did laugh-a devastating sound which shook Bilbo to the
floor, while far up in the tunnel the dwarves huddled together and imagined that
the hobbit had come to a sudden and a nasty end.</p>
<p>"Revenge!" he snorted, and the light of his eyes lit the the hall
from floor to ceiling like scarlet lightning. "Revenge! The King under the
Mountain is dead and where are hi kin that dare seek revenge? Girion Lord of
Dale is dead, and I have eaten his people like a wolf among sheep, and where are
his sons' sons that dare approach me? I kill where I wish and none dare resist.
I laid low the warriors of old and their like is not in the world today. Then I
was but young and tender. Now I am old and strong, strong strong. Thief in the
Shadows!" he gloated. "My armour is like tenfold shields, my teeth are
swords, my claws spears, the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a
hurricane, and my breath death!"</p>
<p>"I have always understood," said Bilbo in a frightened squeak,
"that dragons were softer underneath, especially in the region of
the-er-chest; but doubtless one so fortified has thought of that."</p>
<p>The dragon stopped short in his boasting. "Your information is
antiquated," he snapped. "I am armoured above and below with iron
scales and hard gems. No blade can pierce me."</p>
<p>"I might have guessed it," said Bilbo. "Truly there can;
nowhere be found the equal of Lord Smaug the Impenetrable. What magnificence to
possess a waistcoat of fine diamonds!"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is rare and wonderful, indeed," said Smaug absurdly
pleased. He did not know that the hobbit had already caught a glimpse of his
peculiar under-covering on his previous visit, and was itching for a closer view
for reasons of his own. The dragon rolled over. "Look!" he said.
"What do you say to that?"</p>
<p>"Dazzlingly marvellous! Perfect! Flawless! Staggering!" exclaimed
Bilbo aloud, but what he thought inside was: "Old fool! Why there is a
large patch in the hollow of his left breast as bare as a snail out of its
shell!"</p>
<p>After he had seen that Mr. Baggins' one idea was to get away. "Well, I
really must not detain Your Magnificence any longer," he said, "or
keep you from much needed rest. Ponies take some catching, I believe, after a
long start. And so do burglars," he added as a parting shot, as he darted
back and fled up the tunnel.</p>
<p>It was an unfortunate remark, for the dragon spouted terrific flames after
him, and fast though he sped up the slope, he had not gone nearly far enough to
be comfortable before the ghastly head of Smaug was thrust against the opening
behind. Luckily the whole head and jaws could not squeeze in, but the nostrils
sent forth fire and vapour to pursue him, and he was nearly overcome, and
stumbled blindly on in great pain and fear. He had been feeling rather pleased
with the cleverness of his conversation with Smaug, but his mistake at the end
shook him into better sense.</p>
<p>"Never laugh at live dragons, Bilbo you fool!" he said to himself,
and it became a favourite saying of his later, and passed into a proverb.
"You aren't nearly through this adventure yet," he added, and that was
pretty true as well.</p>
<p>The afternoon was turning into evening when he came out again and stumbled
and fell in a faint on the 'door-step.' The dwarves revived him, and doctored
his scorches as well as they could; but it was a long time before the hair on
the back of his head and his heels grew properly again: it had all been singed
and frizzled right down to the skin. In the meanwhile his friends did their best
to cheer him up; and they were eager for his story, especially wanting to know
why the dragon had made such an awful noise, and how Bilbo had escaped.</p>
<p>But the hobbit was worried and uncomfortable, and they had difficulty in
getting anything out of him. On thinking things over he was now regretting some
of the things he had said to the dragon, and was not eager to repeat them. The
old thrush was sitting on a rock near by with his head cocked on one side,
listening to all that was said. It shows what an ill temper Bilbo was in: he
picked up a stone and threw it at the thrush, which merely fluttered aside and
came back.</p>
<p>"Drat the bird!" said Bilbo crossly. "I believe he is
listening, and I don't like the look of him."</p>
<p>"Leave him alone!" said Thorin. "The thrushes are good and
friendly-this is a very old bird indeed, and is maybe the last left of the
ancient breed that used to live about here, tame to the hands of my father and
grandfather. They were a long-lived and magical race, and this might even be one
of those that were alive then, a couple of hundreds years or more ago. The Men
of Dale used to have the trick of understanding their language, and used them
for messengers to fly to the Men of the Lake and elsewhere."</p>
<p>"Well, he'll have news to take to Lake-town all right, if that is what
he is after," said Bilbo; "though I don't suppose there are any people
left there that trouble with thrush-language."</p>
<p>"Why what has happened?" cried the dwarves. "Do get on with
your tale!"</p>
<p>So Bilbo told them all he could remember, and he confessed that he had a
nasty feeling that the dragon guessed too much from his riddles added to the
camps and the ponies. "I am sure he knows we came from Lake-town and had
help from there; and I have a horrible feeling that his next move may be in that
direction. I wish to goodness I had never said that about Barrel-rider; it would
make even a blind rabbit in these parts think of the Lake-men."</p>
<p>"Well, well! It cannot be helped, and it is difficult not to slip in
talking to a dragon, or so I have always heard," said Balin anxious to
comfort him. "I think you did very well, if you ask me-you found out one
very useful thing at any rate, and got home alive, and that is more than most
can say who have had words with the likes of Smaug. It may be a mercy and a
blessing yet to know of the bare patch in the old Worm's diamond
waistcoat."</p>
<p>That turned the conversation, and they all began discussing dragon-slayings
historical, dubious, and mythical, and the various sorts of stabs and jabs and
undercuts, and the different arts, devices and stratagems by which they had been
accomplished. The general opinion was that catching a dragon napping was not as
easy as it sounded, and the attempt to stick one or prod one asleep was more
likely to end in disaster than a bold frontal attack. All the while they talked
the thrush listened, till at last when the stars began to peep forth, it
silently spread its wings and flew away. And all the while they talked and the
shadows lengthened Bilbo became more and more unhappy and his foreboding</p>
<p>At last he interrupted them. "I am sure we are very unsafe here,"
he said, "and I don't see the point of sitting here. The dragon has
withered all the pleasant green, and anyway the night has come and it is cold.
But I feel it in my bones that this place will be attacked again. Smaug knows
now how I came down to his hall, and you can trust him to guess where the other
end of the tunnel is. He will break all this side of the Mountain to bits, if
necessary, to stop up our entrance, and if we are smashed with it the better he
will like it."</p>
<p>"You are very gloomy, Mr. Baggins!" said Thorin. "Why has not
Smaug blocked the lower end, then, if he is so eager to keep us out? He has not,
or we should have heard him."</p>
<p>"I don't know, I don't know-because at first he wanted to try and lure
me in again, I suppose, and now perhaps because he is waiting till after
tonight's hunt, or because he does not want to damage his bedroom if he can help
it - but I wish you would not argue. Smaug will be coming out at any minute now,
and our only hope is to get well in the tunnel and shut the door."</p>
<p>He seemed so much in earnest that the dwarves at last did as he said, though
they delayed shutting the door-it seemed a desperate plan, for no one knew
whether or how they could get it open again from the inside, and the thought of
being shut in a place from which the only way out led through the dragon's lair
was not one they liked. Also everything seemed quite quiet, both outside and
down the tunnel. So for a longish while they sat inside not far down from the
half-open door and went on talking. The talk turned to the dragon's wicked words
about the dwarves. Bilbo wished he had never heard them, or at least that he
could feel quite certain that the dwarves now were absolutely honest when they
declared that they had never thought at all about what would happen after the
treasure had been won.</p>
<p>"We knew it would be a desperate venture," said Thorin, "and
we know that still; and I still think that when we have won it will be time
enough to think what to do about it. As for your share, Mr. Baggins, I assure
you we are more than grateful and you shall choose you own fourteenth, as soon
as we have anything to divide, am sorry if you are worried about transport, and
I admit the difficulties are great-the lands have not become less wild with the
passing of time, rather the reverse-but we will do whatever we can for you, and
take our share of the cost when the time comes. Believe me or not as you
like!"</p>
<p>From that the talk turned to the great hoard itself and to the things that
Thorin and Balin remembered. They wondered if they were still lying there
.unharmed in the hall below: the spears that were made for the armies of the
great King Bladorthin (long since dead), each had a thrice-forged head and their
shafts were inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never delivered or paid for;
shields made for warriors long dead; the great golden cup of Thror, two-handed,
hammered and carven with birds and flowers whose eyes and petals were of jewels;
coats of mail gilded and silvered and impenetrable; the necklace of Girion, Lord
of Dale, made of five hundred emeralds green as grass, which he gave for the
arming of his eldest son in a coat of dwarf-linked rings the like of which had
never been made before, for it was wrought of pure silver to the power and
strength of triple steel. But fairest of all was the great white gem, which the
dwarves had found beneath the roots of the Mountain, the Heart of the Mountain,
the Arkenstone of Thrain.</p>
<p>"The Arkenstone! The Arkenstone!" murmured Thorin in the dark, half
dreaming with his chin upon his knees. "It was like a globe with a thousand
facets; it shone like silver in the firelight, like water in the sun, like snow
under the stars, like rain upon the Moon!"</p>
<p>But the enchanted desire of the hoard had fallen from Bilbo. All through
their talk he was only half listening to them. He sat nearest to the door with
one ear cocked for any beginnings of a sound without, his other was alert or
echoes beyond the murmurs of the dwarves, for any whisper of a movement from far
below.</p>
<p>Darkness grew deeper and he grew ever more uneasy. "Shut the door!"
he begged them. "I fear that dragon in my marrow. I like this silence far
less than the uproar of last night. Shut the door before it is too late!"</p>
<p>Something in his voice gave the dwarves an uncomfortable feeling. Slowly
Thorin shook off his dreams and getting up he kicked away the stone that wedged
the door. Then they thrust upon it, and it closed with a snap and a clang. No
trace of a keyhole was there left on the inside. They were shut in the Mountain!</p>
<p>And not a moment too soon. They had hardly gone any distance down the tunnel
when a blow smote the side of the Mountain like the crash of battering-rams made
of forest oaks and swung by giants. The rock boomed, the walls cracked and
stones fell from the roof on their heads. What would have happened if the door
had still been open I don't like to think. They fled further down the tunnel
glad to be still alive, while behind them outside they heard the roar and rumble
of Smaug's fury. He was breaking rocks to pieces, smashing wall and cliff with
the lashings of his huge tail, till their little lofty camping ground, the
scorched grass, the thrush's stone, the snail-covered walls, the narrow ledge,
and all disappeared in a jumble of smithereens, and an avalanche of splintered
stones fell over the cliff into the valley below.</p>
<p>Smaug had left his lair in silent stealth, quietly soared into the air, and
then floated heavy and slow in the dark like a monstrous crow, down the wind
towards the west of the Mountain, in the hopes of catching unawares something or
somebody there, and of spying the outlet to the passage which the thief had
used. This was the outburst of his wrath when he could find nobody and see
nothing, even where he guessed the outlet must actually be.</p>
<p>After he had let off his rage in this way he felt better and he thought in
his heart that he would not be troubled again from that direction. In-the
meanwhile he had further vengeance to take. "Barrel-rider!" he
snorted. "Your fee came from the waterside and up the water you came with
out a doubt. I don't know your smell, but if you are not one of those men of the
Lake, you had their help. They shall see me and remember who is the real King
under the Mountain!"</p>
<p>He rose in fire and went away south towards the Running River.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="13"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
<h2>Not at Home</h2>
<p>In the meanwhile, the dwarves sat in darkness, and utter silence fell about
them. Little they ate and little they spoke. They could not count the passing of
time; and they scarcely dared to move, for the whisper of their voices echoed
and rustled in the tunnel. If they dozed, they woke still to darkness and to
silence going on unbroken. At last after days and days of waiting, as it seemed,
when they were becoming choked and dazed for want of air, they could bear it no
longer. They would almost have welcomed sounds from below of the dragon's
return. In the silence they feared some cunning devilry of his, but they could
not sit there for ever.</p>
<p>Thorin spoke: "Let us try the door!" he said. "I must feel the
wind on my face soon or die. I think I would rather be smashed by Smaug in the
open than suffocate in here!"</p>
<p>So several of the dwarves got up and groped back to where the door had been.
But they found that the upper end of the tunnel had been shattered and blocked
with broken rock. Neither key nor the magic it had once obeyed would ever open
that door again.</p>
<p>"We are trapped!" they groaned. "This is the end. We shall die
here."</p>
<p>But somehow, just when the dwarves were most despairing, Bilbo felt a strange
lightening of the heart, as if a heavy weight had gone from under his waistcoat.</p>
<p>"Come, come!" he said. "While there's life there's hope!"
as my father used to say, and 'Third time pays for all.' I am going down the
tunnel once again. I have been that way twice, when I knew there was a dragon at
the other end, so I will risk a third visit when I am no longer sure. Anyway the
only way out is down. And I think time you had better all come with me."</p>
<p>In desperation they agreed, and Thorin was the first go forward by Bilbo's
side.</p>
<p>"Now do be careful!" whispered the hobbit, "and quiet as you
can be! There may be no Smaug at the bottom but then again there may be. Don't
let us take any unnecessary risks!"</p>
<p>Down, down they went. The dwarves could not, course, compare with the hobbit
in real stealth, and the made a deal of puffing and shuffling which echoes
magnified alarmingly; but though every now and again Bilbo in fear stopped and
listened, not a sound stirred below Near the bottom, as well as he could judge,
Bilbo slipped on his ring and went ahead. But he did not need it: the darkness
was complete, and they were all invisible, ring or no ring. In fact so black was
it that the hobbit came to the opening unexpectedly, put his hand on air,
stumbled for ward, and rolled headlong into the hall!</p>
<p>There he lay face downwards on the floor and did no dare to get up, or hardly
even to breathe. But nothing moved. There was not a gleam of light-unless, as
seemed to him, when at last he slowly raised his head, there was a pale white
glint, above him and far off in the gloom. But certainly it was not a spark of
dragon-fire, though the wormstench was heavy in the place, and the taste of
vapour was on his tongue.</p>
<p>At length Mr. Baggins could bear it no longer. "Come found you, Smaug,
you worm!" he squeaked aloud. "Stop playing hide-and-seek! Give me a
light, and then eat me if you can catch me!"</p>
<p>Faint echoes ran round the unseen hall, but there was no answer. Bilbo got
up, and found that he did not know in what direction to turn.</p>
<p>"Now I wonder what on earth Smaug is playing at," he said. "He
is not at home today (or tonight, or whatever it is), I do believe. If Oin and
Gloin have not lost their time tinder-boxes, perhaps we can make a little light,
and have a look round before the luck turns."</p>
<p>"Light!" he cried. "Can anybody make a light?"</p>
<p>The dwarves, of course, were very alarmed when Bilbo fell forward down the
step with a bump into the hall, and they sat huddled just where he had left them
at the end the tunnel.</p>
<p>"Sh! sh!" they hissed, when they heard his voice: and though that
helped the hobbit to find out where they were, was some time before he could get
anything else out of them. But in the end, when Bilbo actually began to stamp in
the floor, and screamed out light!' at the top of his thrill voice, Thorin gave
way, and Oin and Gloin were sent back to their bundles at the top of the tunnel.
After a while a twinkling gleam showed them returning, in with a small
pine-torch alight in his hand, and Gloin with a bundle of others under his arm.
Quickly Bilbo trotted to the door and took the torch; but he could not persuade
the dwarves to light the others or to come and join him yet. As Thorin carefully
explained, Mr. Baggins was still officially their expert burglar and
investigator. If he liked to risk a light, that was his affair. They would wait
in the tunnel for his report. So they sat near the door and watched.</p>
<p>They saw the little dark shape of the hobbit start across the floor holding
his tiny light aloft. Every now and again, while he was still near enough, they
caught a glint and a tinkle as he stumbled on some golden thing. The light grew
smaller as he wandered away into the vast hall; then it began to rise dancing
into the air. Bilbo was climbing the great mound of treasure. Soon he stood upon
the top, and still went on. Then they saw him halt and stoop for a moment; but
they did not know the reason. It was the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain.
So Bilbo guessed from Thorin's description; but indeed there could not be two
such gems, even in so marvellous a hoard, even in all the world. Ever as he
climbed, the same white gleam had shone before him and drawn his feet towards
Slowly it grew to a little globe of pallid light. Now as came near, it was
tinged with a flickering sparkle of man colours at the surface, reflected and
splintered from the wavering light of his torch. At last he looked down upon it
and he caught his breath. The great jewel shone before he feet of its own inner
light, and yet, cut and fashioned by the dwarves, who had dug it from the heart
of the mountain long ago, it took all light that fell upon it and-changes it
into ten thousand sparks of white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow.</p>
<p>Suddenly Bilbo's arm went towards it drawn by it enchantment. His small hand
would not close about it for it was a large and heavy gem; but he lifted it,
shut his eyes, and put it in his deepest pocket.</p>
<p>"Now I am a burglar indeed!" thought he. "But I suppose I must
tell the dwarves about it-some time. The did say I could pick and choose my own
share; and I think I would choose this, if they took all the rest!" All the
same he had an uncomfortable feeling that the picking and choosing had not
really been meant to include this marvellous gem, and that trouble would yet
come of it. Now he went on again. Down the other side of the great mound he
climbed, and the spark of his torch vanished from the sight of the watching
dwarves. But soon they saw it far away in the distance again. Bilbo was crossing
the floor of the hall.</p>
<p>He went on, until he came to the great doors at the further side, and there a
draught of air refreshed him, but it almost puffed out his light. He peeped
timidly through and caught a glimpse of great passages and of the dim beginnings
of wide stairs going up into the gloom. And still there was no sight nor sound
of Smaug. He was just going to turn and go back, when a black shape swooped at
him and brushed his face. He squeaked and started, stumbled backwards and fell.
His torch dropped head downwards and went out!</p>
<p>"Only a bat, I suppose and hope!" he said miserably. But now what
am I to do? Which is East, South, North West?"</p>
<p>"Thorin! Balin! Oin! Gloin! Fill! Kili!" he cried as loud he
could-it seemed a thin little noise in the wide blackness. "The light's
gone out! Someone come and find and help me!" For the moment his courage
had failed together.</p>
<p>Faintly the dwarves heard his small cries, though the only word they could
catch was 'help!'</p>
<p>"Now what on earth or under it has happened?" said Thorin.
"Certainly not the dragon, or he would not go on squeaking."</p>
<p>They waited a moment or two, and still there were no dragon-noises, no sound
at all in fact but Bilbo's distant voice. "Come, one of you, get another
light or two!" Thorin ordered. "It seems we have got to go and help
our burglar."</p>
<p>"It is about our turn to help," said Balin, "and I am quite
willing to go. Anyway I expect it is safe for the moment."</p>
<p>Gloin lit several more torches, and then they all crept out, one by one, and
went along the wall as hurriedly as they could. It was not long before they met
Bilbo himself coming back towards them. His wits had quickly returned soon as he
saw the twinkle of their lights.</p>
<p>"Only a bat and a dropped torch, nothing worse!" he said in answer
to their questions. Though they were much relieved, they were inclined to be
grumpy at being frightened for nothing; but what they would have said, if he had
told them at that moment about the Arkenstone, I don't know. The mere fleeting
glimpses of treasure which they had caught as they went along had rekindled all
the fire of their dwarvish hearts; and when the heart of a dwarf, even the most
respectable, is wakened by gold and by jewels, he grows suddenly bold, and he
may become fierce.</p>
<p>The dwarves indeed no longer needed any urging. All were now eager to explore
the hall while they had the chance, and willing to believe that, for the
present, Smaug was away from home. Each now gripped a lighted torch; and as they
gazed, first on one side and then on another, they forgot fear and even caution.
They spoke aloud, and cried out to one another, as they lifted old treasures
from the mound or from the wall and held them in the light caressing and
fingering them. Fili and Kili were almost in merry mood, and finding still
hanging there many golden harps strung with silver they took them and struck
them; and being magical (and also untouched by the dragon, who had small
interests in music) they were still in tune. The dark hall was filled with a
melody that had long been silent. But most of the dwarves were more practical;
they gathered gems and stuffed their pockets, and let what they could not carry
far back through their fingers with a sigh. Thorin was not least among these;
but always he searched from side to side for something which he could not find.
It was the Arkenstone but he spoke of it yet to no one.</p>
<p>Now the dwarves took down mail and weapons from the walls, and armed
themselves. Royal indeed did Thorin look, clad in a coat of gold-plated rings,
with a silver hafted axe in a belt crusted with scarlet stones.</p>
<p>"Mr. Baggins!" he cried. "Here is the first payment of your
reward! Cast off your old coat and put on this!"</p>
<p>With that he put on Bilbo a small coat of mail, wrought for some young
elf-prince long ago. It was of silver-steel which the elves call mithril, and
with it went a belt of pearls and crystals. A light helm of figured leather,
strengthened beneath with hoops of steel, and studded about the bring with white
gems, was set upon the hobbit's head.</p>
<p>"I feel magnificent," he thought; "but I expect I look rather
absurd. How they would laugh on the Hill at home Still I wish there was a
looking-glass handy!"</p>
<p>All the same Mr. Baggins kept his head more clear of the bewitchment of the
hoard than the dwarves did. Long before the dwarves were tired of examining the
treasures he became wary of it and sat down on the floor; and he began to wonder
nervously what the end of it all would be</p>
<p>"I would give a good many of these precious goblets, thought, "for
a drink of something cheering out of one Beorn's wooden bowls!"</p>
<p>"Thorin!" he cried aloud. "What next? We are armed, but what
good has any armour ever been before against Smaug the Dreadful? This treasure
is not yet won back. We are not looking for gold yet, but for a way of escape;
and we have tempted luck too long!"</p>
<p>'"You speak the truth!" answered Thorin, recovering his wits.
"Let us go! I will guide you. Not in a thousand years should I forget the
ways of this palace." Then he hailed the others, and they gathered
together, and holding their torches above their heads they passed through the
gaping doors, not without many a backward glance of longing.</p>
<p>Their glittering mail they had covered again with their old cloaks and their
bright helms with their tattered hoods, and one by one they walked behind
Thorin, a line of little lights in the darkness that halted often, listening in
fear once more for any rumour of the dragon's coming. Though all the old
adornments were long mouldered or destroyed, and though all was befouled and
blasted with the comings and goings of the monster, Thorin knew every passage
and every turn. They climbed long stairs, and turned and went down wide echoing
ways, and turned again and climbed yet more stairs, and yet more' stairs again.</p>
<p>These were smooth, cut out of the living rock broad and lair; and up, up, the
dwarves went, and they met no sign of any living thing, only furtive shadows
that fled from the approach of their torches fluttering in the draughts. The
steps were not made, all the same, for hobbit-legs, and Bilbo was just feeling
that he could go on no longer, when suddenly the roof sprang high and far beyond
the reach of their torch-light. A white glimmer could be seen coming through
some opening far above, and the air smelt sweeter. Before them light came dimly
through great doors, that hung twisted on their hinges and half burnt.</p>
<p>"This is the great chamber of Thror," said Thorin; "the hall
of feasting and of council. Not far off now is the Front Gate."</p>
<p>They passed through the ruined chamber. Tables were rotting there; chairs and
benches were lying there overturned, charred and decaying. Skulls and bones were
upon the floor among flagons and bowls and broken drinking-horns and dust. As
they came through yet more doors at the further end, a sound of water fell upon
their ears, and the grey light grew suddenly more full.</p>
<p>"There is the birth of the Running River," said Thorin. "From
here it hastens to the Gate. Let us follow it!"</p>
<p>Out of a dark opening in a wall of rock there issued a boiling water, and it
flowed swirling in a narrow channel, carved and made straight and deep by the
cunning of ancient hands. Beside it ran a stone-paved road, wide enough for many
men abreast. Swiftly along this they ran, and round a wide-sweeping turn-and
behold! before them stood the broad light of day. In front there rose a tall
arch, still showing the fragments of old carven work within, worn and splintered
and blackened though it was. A misty sun sent its pale light between the arms of
the Mountain, and beams of gold fell on the pavement at the threshold.</p>
<p>A whirl of bats frightened from slumber by their smoking torches flurried
over them; as they sprang forward their feet slithered on stones rubbed smooth
and slimed by the passing of the dragon. Now before them the water fell noisily
outward and foamed down towards the valley. They flung their pale torches to the
ground, and stood gazing out with dazzled eyes. They were come to the Front
Gate, and were looking out upon Dale.</p>
<p>"Well!" said Bilbo, "I never expected to be looking out of
this door. And I never expected to be so pleased to see the sun again, and to
feel the wind on my face. But, ow! this wind is cold!"</p>
<p>It was. A bitter easterly breeze blew with a threat of oncoming winter. It
swirled over and round the arms of the Mountain into the valley, and sighed
among the rocks. After their long time in the stewing depths of the
dragon-haunted caverns, they shivered in the sun. Suddenly Bilbo realized that
he was not only tired but also very hungry indeed. "It seems to be late
morning," he said, "and so I suppose it is more or less breakfast-time
- if there is any breakfast to have. But I don't feel that Smaug's front
doorstep is the safest place for a meal. Do let's go somewhere where we can sit
quiet for a bit!"</p>
<p>"Quite right!" said Balin. "And I think I know which way we
should go: we ought to make for the old look-out post at the Southwest corner of
the Mountain."</p>
<p>"How far is that?" asked the hobbit.</p>
<p>"Five hours march, I should think. It will be rough going. The road from
the Gate along the left edge of the stream seems all broken up. But look down
there! The river loops suddenly east across Dale in front of the ruined town. At
that point there was once a bridge, leading to steep stairs that climbed up the
right bank, and so to a road running towards Ravenhill. There is (or was) a path
that left the road and climbed up to the post. A hard climb, too, even if the
old steps are still there."</p>
<p>"Dear me!" grumbled the hobbit. "More walking and more
climbing without breakfast! I wonder how many breakfasts, and other meals, we
have missed inside that nasty clockless, timeless hole?"</p>
<p>As a matter of fact two nights and the day between had gone by (and not
altogether without food) since the dragon smashed the magic door, but Bilbo had
quite lost count, and it might have been one night or a week of nights for all
he could tell.</p>
<p>"Come, come!" said Thorin laughing - his spirits had begun to rise
again, and he rattled the precious stones in his pockets. "Don't call my
place a nasty hole! You wait till it has been cleaned and redecorated!"</p>
<p>"That won't be till Smaug's dead," said Bilbo glumly. "In the
meanwhile where is he? I would give a good breakfast to know. I hope he is not
up on the Mountain looking down at us!"</p>
<p>That idea disturbed the dwarves mightily, and they quickly decided that Bilbo
and Balin were right.</p>
<p>"We must move away from here," said Don. "I feel as if his
eyes were on the back of my head."</p>
<p>"It's a cold lonesome place," said Bombur. "There may be
drink, but I see no sign of food. A dragon would always be hungry in such
parts."</p>
<p>"Come on! Come on!" cried the others. "Let us follow Balm's
path!"</p>
<p>Under the rocky wall to the right there was no path, so on they trudged among
the stones on the left side of the river, and the emptiness and desolation soon
sobered even Thorin again. The bridge that Balin had spoken of they found long
fallen, and most of its stones were now only boulders in the shallow noisy
stream; but they forded the water without much difficulty, and found the ancient
steps, and climbed the high bank. After going a short way they struck the old
road, and before long came to a deep dell sheltered among the rocks; there they
rested for a while and had such a breakfast as they could, chiefly cram and
water. (If you want to know what cram is, I can only say that I don't know the
recipe; but it is biscuitish, keeps good indefinitely, is supposed to be
sustaining, and is certainly not entertaining, being in fact very uninteresting
except as a chewing exercise. It was made by the Lake-men for long journeys).</p>
<p>After that they went on again; and now the road struck westwards and left the
river, and the great shoulder of the south-pointing mountain-spur drew ever
nearer. At length they reached the hill path. It scrambled steeply up, and they
plodded slowly one behind the other, till at last in the late afternoon they
came to the top of the ridge and saw the wintry sun going downwards to the West.</p>
<p>Here they found a flat place without a wall on three sides, but backed to the
North by a rocky face in which there was an opening like a door. From that door
there was a wide view East and South and West.</p>
<p>"Here," said Balin, "in the old days we used always to keep
watchmen, and that door behind leads into a rock-hewn chamber that was made here
as a guardroom. There were several places like it round the Mountain. But there
seemed small need for watching in the days of our prosperity, and the guards
were made over comfortable, perhaps - otherwise we might have had longer
warnings of the coming of the dragon, and things might have been different.
Still, "here we can now lie hid and sheltered for a while, and can see much
without being seen."</p>
<p>"Not much use, if we have been seen coming here," said Dori, who
was always looking up towards the Mountain's peak, as if he expected to see
Smaug perched there like a bird on a steeple.</p>
<p>"We must take our chance of that," said Thorin. "We can go no
further to-day."</p>
<p>"Hear, hear!" cried Bilbo, and flung himself on the ground.</p>
<p>In the rock-chamber there would have been room for a hundred, and there was a
small chamber further in, more removed from the cold outside. It was quite
deserted; not even wild animals seemed to have used it in all the days of
Smaug's dominion. There they laid their burdens; and some threw themselves down
at once and slept, but the others sat near the outer door and discussed their
plans.</p>
<p>In all their talk they came perpetually back to one thing: where was Smaug?
They looked West and there was nothing, and East there was nothing, and in the
South there was no sign of the dragon, but there was a gathering of very many
birds. At that they gazed and wondered; but they were no nearer understanding
it, when the first cold stars came out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="14"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 14</h2>
<h2>Fire and Water</h2>
<p>Now if you wish, like the dwarves, to hear news of Smaug, you must go back
again to the evening when he smashed the door and flew off in rage, two days
before.</p>
<p>The men of the lake-town Esgaroth were mostly indoors, for the breeze was
from the black East and chill, but a few were walking on the quays, and
watching, as they were fond of doing, the stars shine out from the smooth
patches of the lake as they opened in the sky. From their town the Lonely
Mountain was mostly screened by the low hills at the far end of the lake,
through a gap in which the Running River came down from the North. Only its high
peak could they see in clear weather, and they looked seldom at it, for it was
ominous and dreary even in the light of morning. Now it was lost and gone,
blotted in the dark.</p>
<p>Suddenly it flickered back to view; a brief glow touched it and faded.</p>
<p>"Look!" said one. "The lights again! Last night the watchmen
saw them start and fade from midnight until dawn. Something is happening up
there."</p>
<p>"Perhaps the King under the Mountain is forging gold," said
another. "It is long since he went north. It is time the songs began to
prove themselves again."</p>
<p>"Which king?" said another with a grim voice. "As like as not
it is the marauding fire of the Dragon, the only king under the Mountain we have
ever known."</p>
<p>"You are always foreboding gloomy things!" said the others.
"Anything from floods to poisoned fish. Think of something cheerful!"</p>
<p>Then suddenly a great light appeared in the low place in the hills and the
northern end of the lake turned golden.</p>
<p>"The King beneath the Mountain!" they shouted. "His wealth is
like the Sun, his silver like a fountain, his rivers golden run! The river is
running gold from the Mountain!" they cried, and everywhere windows were
opening and feet were hurrying.</p>
<p>There was once more a tremendous excitement and enthusiasm. But the
grim-voiced fellow ran hotfoot to the Master. "The dragon is coming or I am
a fool!" he cried. "Cut the bridges! To arms! To arms!"</p>
<p>Then warning trumpets were suddenly sounded, and echoed along the rocky
shores. The cheering stopped and the joy was turned to dread. So it was that the
dragon did not find them quite unprepared. Before long, so great was his speed,
they could see him as a spark of fire rushing towards them and growing ever
huger and more bright, and not the most foolish doubted that the prophecies had
gone rather wrong. Still they had a little time. Every vessel in the town was
filled with water, every warrior was armed, every arrow and dart was ready, and
the bridge to the land was thrown down and destroyed, before the roar of Smaug's
terrible approach grew loud, and the lake rippled red as fire beneath the awful
beating of his wings.</p>
<p>Amid shrieks and wailing and the shouts of men he came over them, swept
towards the bridges and was foiled! The bridge was gone, and his enemies were on
an island in deep water-too deep and dark and cool for his liking. If he plunged
into it, a vapour and a steam would arise enough to cover all the land with a
mist for days; but the lake was mightier than he, it would quench him before he
could pass through.</p>
<p>Roaring he swept back over the town. A hail of dark arrows leaped up and
snapped and rattled on his scales and jewels, and their shafts fell back kindled
by his breath burning and hissing into the lake. No fireworks you ever imagined
equalled the sights that night. At the twanging of the bows and the shrilling of
the trumpets the dragon's wrath blazed to its height, till he was blind and mad
with it. No one had dared to give battle to him for many an age; nor would they
have dared now, if it had not been for the grim-voiced man (Bard was his name),
who ran to and fro cheering on the archers and urging the Master to order them
to fight to the last arrow.</p>
<p>Fire leaped from the dragon's jaws. He circled for a while high in the air
above them lighting all the lake; the trees by the shores shone like copper and
like blood with leaping shadows of dense black at their feet. Then down he
swooped straight through the arrow-storm, reckless in his rage, taking no heed
to turn his scaly sides towards his foes, seeking only to set their town ablaze.</p>
<p>Fire leaped from thatched roofs and wooden beam-ends as he hurtled down and
past and round again, though all had been drenched with water before he came.
Once more water was flung by a hundred hands wherever a spark appeared. Back
swirled the dragon. A sweep of his tail and the roof of the Great House crumbled
and smashed down. Flames unquenchable sprang high into the night. Another swoop
and another, and another house and then another sprang afire and fell; and still
no arrow hindered Smaug or hurt him more than a fly from the marshes. Already
men were jumping into the water on every side. Women and children were being
huddled into laden boats in the market-pool. Weapons were flung down. There was
mourning and weeping, where but a little time ago the old songs of mirth to come
had been sung about the dwarves. Now men cursed their names. The Master himself
was turning to his great gilded boat, hoping to row away in the confusion and
save himself. Soon all the town would be deserted and burned down to the surface
of the lake. That was the dragon's hope. They could all get into boats for all
he cared. There he could have fine sport hunting them, or they could stop till
they starved. Let them try to get to land and he would be ready. Soon he would
set all the shoreland woods ablaze and wither every field and pasture. Just now
he was enjoying the sport of town-baiting more than he had enjoyed anything for
years. But there was still a company of archers that held their ground among the
burning houses. Their captain was Bard, grim-voiced and grim-faced, whose
friends had accused him of prophesying floods and poisoned fish, though they
knew his worth and courage. He was a descendant in long line of Girion, Lord of
Dale, whose wife and child had escaped down the Running River from the ruin long
ago. Now he shot with a great yew bow, till all his arrows but one were spent.
The flames were near him. His companions were leaving him. He bent his bow for
the last time. Suddenly out of the dark something fluttered to his shoulder. He
started-but it was only an old thrush. Unafraid it perched by his ear and it
brought him news. Marvelling he found he could understand its tongue, for he was
of the race of Dale.</p>
<p>"Wait! Wait!" it said to him. "The moon is rising. Look for
the hollow of the left breast as he flies and turns above you!" And while
Bard paused in wonder it told him of tidings up in the Mountain and of all that
it had heard. Then Bard drew his bow-string to his ear. The dragon was circling
back, flying low, and as he came the moon rose above the eastern shore and
silvered his great wings.</p>
<p>"Arrow!" said the bowman. "Black arrow! I have saved you to
the last. You have never failed me and always I have recovered you. I had you
from my father and he from of old. If ever you came from the forges of the true
king under the Mountain, go now and speed well!"</p>
<p>The dragon swooped once more lower than ever, and as he turned and dived down
his belly glittered white with sparkling fires of gems in the moon-but not in
one place. The great bow twanged. The black arrow sped straight from the string,
straight for the hollow by the left breast where the foreleg was flung wide. In
it smote and vanished, barb, shaft and feather, so fierce was its flight. With a
shriek that deafened men, felled trees and split stone, Smaug shot spouting into
the air, turned over and crashed down from on high in ruin.</p>
<p>Full on the town he fell. His last throes splintered it to sparks and gledes.
The lake roared in. A vast steam leaped up, white in the sudden dark under the
moon. There was a hiss, a gushing whirl, and then silence. And that was the end
of Smaug and Esgaroth, but not of Bard. The waxing moon rose higher and higher
and the wind grew loud and cold. It twisted the white fog into bending pillars
and hurrying clouds and drove it off to the West to scatter in tattered shreds
over the marshes before Mirkwood. Then the many boats could be seen dotted dark
on the surface of the lake, and down the wind came the voices of the people of
Esgaroth lamenting their lost town and goods and ruined houses. But they had
really much to be thankful for, had they thought of it, though it could hardly
be expected that they should just then: three quarters of the people of the town
had at least escaped alive; their woods and fields and pastures and cattle and
most of their boats remained undamaged; and the dragon was dead. What that meant
they had not yet realized.</p>
<p>They gathered in mournful crowds upon the western shores, shivering in the
cold wind, and their first complaints and anger were against the Master, who had
left the town so soon, while some were still willing to defend it.</p>
<p>"He may have a good head for business-especially his own business,"
some murmured, "but he is no good when anything serious happens!" And
they praised the courage of Bard and his last mighty shot. "If only he had
not been killed," they all said, "we would make him a king. Bard the
Dragon-shooter of the line of Girion! Alas that he is lost!"</p>
<p>And in the very midst of their talk, a tall figure stepped from the shadows.
He was drenched with water, his black hair hung wet over his face and shoulders,
and a fierce light was in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Bard is not lost!" he cried. "He dived from Esgaroth, when
the enemy was slain. I am Bard, of the line of Girion; I am the slayer of the
dragon!"</p>
<p>"King Bard! King Bard!" they shouted; but the Master ground his
chattering teeth.</p>
<p>"Girion was lord of Dale, not king of Esgaroth," he said. "In
the Lake-town we have always elected masters from among the old and wise, and
have not endured the rule of mere fighting men. Let 'King Bard' go back to his
own kingdom-Dale is now freed by his valour, and nothing binders his return. And
any that wish can go with him, if they prefer the cold shores under the shadow
of the Mountain to the green shores of the lake. The wise will stay here and
hope to rebuild our town, and enjoy again in time its peace and riches."</p>
<p>"We will have King Bard!" the people near at hand shouted in reply.
"We have had enough of the old men and the money-counters!" And people
further off took up the cry: "Up the Bowman, and down with Moneybags,"
till the clamour echoed along the shore.</p>
<p>"I am the last man to undervalue Bard the Bowman," said the Master
warily (for Bard now stood close beside him). "He has tonight earned an
eminent place in the roll of the benefactors of our town; and he is worthy of
many imperishable songs. But, why O People?"-and here the Master rose to
his feet and spoke very loud and clear - "why do I get all your blame? For
what fault am I to be deposed? Who aroused the dragon from his slumber, I might
ask? Who obtained of us rich gifts and ample help, and led us to believe that
old songs could come true? Who played on our soft hearts and our pleasant
fancies? What sort of gold have they sent down the river to reward us?
Dragon-fire and ruin! From whom should we claim the recompense of our damage,
and aid for our widows and orphans?"</p>
<p>As you see, the Master had not got his position for nothing. The result of
his words was that for the moment the people quite forgot their idea of a new
king, and turned their angry thoughts towards Thorin and his company. Wild and
bitter words were shouted from many sides; and some of those who had before sung
the old songs loudest, were now heard as loudly crying that the dwarves had
stirred the dragon up against them deliberately!</p>
<p>"Fools!" said Bard. "Why waste words and wrath on those
unhappy creatures? Doubtless they perished first in fire, before Smaug came to
us." Then even as he was speaking, the thought came into his heart of the
fabled treasure of the Mountain lying without guard or owner, and he fell
suddenly silent. He thought of the Master's words, and of Dale rebuilt, and
filled with golden bells, if he could but find the men.</p>
<p>At length he spoke again: "This is no time for angry words. Master, or
for considering weighty plans of change. There is work to do. I serve you
still-though after a while I may think again of your words and go North with any
that will follow me."</p>
<p>Then he strode off to help in the ordering of the camps and in the care of
the sick and the wounded. But the Master scowled at his back as he went, and
remained sitting on the ground. He thought much but said little, unless it was
to call loudly for men to bring him fire and food. Now everywhere Bard went he
found talk running like fire among the people concerning the vast treasure that
was now unguarded. Men spoke of the recompense for all their harm that they
would soon get from it, and wealth over and to spare with which to buy rich
things from the South; and it cheered them greatly in their plight. That was as
well, for the night was bitter and miserable. Shelters could be contrived for
few (the Master had one) and there was little food (even the Master went short).
Many took ill of wet and cold and sorrow that night, and afterwards died, who
had escaped uninjured from the ruin of the town; and in the days that followed
there was much sickness and great hunger.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bard took the lead, and ordered things as he wished, though always
in the Master's name, and he had a hard task to govern the people and direct the
preparations for their protection and housing. Probably most of them would have
perished in the winter that now hurried after autumn, if help had not been to
hand. But help came swiftly; for Bard at once had speedy messengers sent up the
river to the Forest to ask the aid of the King of the Elves of the Wood, and
these messengers had found a host already on the move, although it was then only
the third day after the fall of Smaug.</p>
<p>The Elvenking had received news from his own messengers and from the birds
that loved his folk, and already knew much of what had happened. Very great
indeed was the commotion among all things with wings that dwelt on the borders
of the Desolation of the Dragon. The air was filled with circling flocks, and
their swift-flying messengers flew here and there across the sky. Above the
borders of the Forest there was whistling, crying and piping. Far over Mirkwood
tidings spread: "Smaug is dead!" Leaves rustled and startled ears were
lifted. Even before the Elvenking rode forth the news had passed west right to
the pinewoods of the Misty Mountains; Beorn had heard it in his wooden house,
and the goblins were at council in their caves.</p>
<p>"That will be the last we shall hear of Thorin Oakenshield, I
fear," said the king. "He would have done better to have remained my
guest. It is an ill wind, all the same," he added, "that blows no one
any good." For he too had not forgotten the legend of the wealth of Thror.
So it was that Bard's messengers found him now marching with many spearmen and
bowmen; and crows were gathered thick, above him, for they thought that war was
awakening again, such as had not been in those parts for a long age. But the
king, when he received the prayers of Bard, had pity, for he was the lord of a
good and kindly people; so turning his march, which had at first been direct
towards the Mountain, he hastened now down the river to the Long Lake. He had
not boats or rafts enough for his host, and they were forced to go the slower
way by foot; but great store of goods he sent ahead by water. Still elves are
light-footed, and though they were not in these days much used to the marches
and the treacherous lands between the Forest and the Lake, their going was
swift. Only five days after the death of the dragon they came upon the shores
and looked on the ruins of the town. Their welcome was good, as may be expected,
and the men and their Master were ready to make any bargain for the future in
return for the Elvenking's aid.</p>
<p>Their plans were soon made. With the women and the children, the old and the
unfit, the Master remained behind; and with him were some men of crafts and many
skilled elves; and they busied themselves felling trees, and collecting the
timber sent down from the Forest. Then they set about raising many huts by the
shore against the oncoming winter; and also under the Master's direction they
began the planning of a new town, designed more fair and large even than before,
but not in the same place. They removed northward higher up the shore; for ever
after they had a dread of the water where the dragon lay. He would never again
return to his golden bed, but was stretched cold as stone, twisted upon the
floor of the shallows. There for ages his huge bones could be seen in calm
weather amid the ruined piles of the old town. But few dared to cross the cursed
spot, and none dared to dive into the shivering water or recover the precious
stones that fell from his rotting carcass.</p>
<p>But all the men of arms who were still able, and the most of the Elvenking's
array, got ready to march north to the Mountain. It was thus that in eleven days
from the ruin of the town the head of their host passed the rock-gates at the
end of the lake and came into the desolate lands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="15"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<h2>The Gathering of the Clouds</h2>
<p>Now we will return to Bilbo and the dwarves. All night one of them had
watched, but when morning came they had not heard or seen any sign of danger.
But ever more thickly the birds were gathering. Their companies came flying from
the South; and the crows that still lived about the Mountain were wheeling and
crying unceasingly above.</p>
<p>"Something strange is happening," said Thorin. "The time has
gone for the autumn wanderings; and these are birds that dwell always in the
land; there are starlings and flocks of finches; and far off there are many
carrion birds as if a battle were afoot!"</p>
<p>Suddenly Bilbo pointed: "There is that old thrush again!" he cried.
"He seems to have escaped, when Smaug smashed the mountain-side, but I
don't suppose the snails have!"</p>
<p>Sure enough the old thrush was there, and as Bilbo pointed, he flew towards
them and perched on a stone near by. Then he fluttered his wings and sang; then
he cocked his head on one side, as if to listen; and again he sang, and again he
listened.</p>
<p>"I believe he is trying to tell us something," said Balin;
"but I cannot follow the speech of such birds, it is very quick and
difficult. Can you make it out Baggins?"</p>
<p>"Not very well," said Bilbo (as a matter of fact, he could make
nothing of it at all); "but the old fellow seems .very excited."</p>
<p>"I only wish he was a raven!" said Balin.</p>
<p>"I thought you did not like them! You seemed very shy of them, when we
came this way before."</p>
<p>"Those were crows! And nasty suspicious-looking creatures at that, and
rude as well. You must have heard the ugly names they were calling after us. But
the ravens are different. There used to be great friendship between them and the
people of Thror; and they often brought us secret news, and were rewarded with
such bright things as they coveted to hide in their dwellings.</p>
<p>"They live many a year, and their memories are long, and they hand on
their wisdom to their children. I knew many among the ravens of the rocks when I
was a dwarf- lad. This very height was once named Ravenhill, because there was a
wise and famous pair, old Care and his wife, that lived here above the
guard-chamber. But I don't suppose that any of that ancient breed linger here
now."</p>
<p>No sooner had he finished speaking than the old thrush gave a loud call, and
immediately flew away.</p>
<p>"We may not understand him, but that old bird understands us, I am
sure," said Balin. "Keep watch now, and see what happens!"</p>
<p>Before long there was a fluttering of wings, and back came the thrush; and
with him came a most decrepit old bird. He was getting blind, he could hardly
fly, and the top of his head was bald. He was an aged raven of great size. He
alighted stiffly on the ground before them, slowly flapped his wings, and bobbed
towards Thorin.</p>
<p>"O Thorin son of Thrain, and Balin son of Fundin," he croaked (and
Bilbo could understand what he said, for he used ordinary language and not
bird-speech). "I am Roac son of Carc. Carc is dead, but he was well known
to you once. It is a hundred years and three and fifty since I came out of the
egg, but I do not forget what my father told me. Now I am the chief of the great
ravens of the Mountain. We are few, but we remember still the king that was of
old. Most of my people are abroad, for there are great tidings in the South -
some are tidings of joy to you, and some you will not think so good.</p>
<p>"Behold! the birds are gathering back again to the Mountain and to Dale
from South and East and West, for word has gone out that Smaug is dead!"</p>
<p>"Dead! Dead?" shouted the dwarves. "Dead! Then we have been in
needless fear-and the treasure is ours!"</p>
<p>They all sprang up and began to caper about for joy.</p>
<p>"Yes, dead," said Roac. "The thrush, may his feathers never
fall, saw him die, and we may trust his words. He saw him fall in battle with
the men of Esgaroth the third night back from now at the rising of the
moon."</p>
<p>It was some time before Thorin could bring the dwarves to be silent and
listen to the raven's news. At length when he had told all the tale of the
battle he went on:</p>
<p>"So much for joy, Thorin Oakenshield. You may go back to your halls in
safety; all the treasure is yours-for the moment. But many are gathering hither
beside the birds. The news of the death of the guardian has already gone far and
wide, and the legend of the wealth of Thror has not lost in the telling during
many years; many are eager for a share of the spoil. Already a host of the elves
is on the way, and carrion birds are with them hoping for battle and slaughter.
By the lake men murmur that their sorrows are due to the dwarves; for they are
homeless and many have died, and Smaug has destroyed their town. They too think
to find amends from your treasure, whether you are alive or dead.</p>
<p>"Your own wisdom must decide your course, but thirteen is small remnant
of the great folk of Durin that once dwelt here, and now are scattered far. If
you will listen to my counsel, you will not trust the Master of the Lake-men,
but rather him that shot the dragon with his bow. Bard is he, of the race of
Dale, of the line of Girion; he is a grim man but true. We would see peace once
more among dwarves and men and elves after the long desolation; but it may cost
you dear in gold. I have spoken."</p>
<p>Then Thorin burst forth in anger: "Our thanks, Roac Carc's son. You and
your people shall not be forgotten. But none of our gold shall thieves take or
the violent carry off while we are alive. If you would earn our thanks still
more, bring us news of any that draw near. Also I would beg of you, if any of
you are still young and strong of wing, that you would send messengers to our
kin in the mountains of the North, both west from here and east, and tell them
of our plight. But go specially to my cousin Dain in the Iron Hills, for he has
many people well-armed, and dwells nearest to this place. Bid him hasten!"</p>
<p>"I will not say if this counsel be good or bad," croaked Roac;
"but I will do what can be done." Then off he slowly flew.</p>
<p>"Back now to the Mountain!" cried Thorin. "We have little time
to lose."</p>
<p>"And little food to use!" cried Bilbo, always practical on such
points. In any case he felt that the adventure was, properly speaking, over
.with the death of the dragon-in which he was much mistaken-and he would have
given most of his share of the profits for the peaceful winding up of these
affairs.</p>
<p>"Back to the Mountain!" cried the dwarves as if they had not heard
him; so back he had to go with them. As you have heard some of the events
already, you will see that the dwarves still had some days before them. They
explored the caverns once more, and found, as they expected, that only the Front
Gate remained open; all the other gates (except, of course, the small secret
door) had long ago been broken and blocked by Smaug, and no sign of them
remained. So now they began to labour hard in fortifying the main entrance, and
in remaking the road that led from it. Tools were to be found in plenty that the
miners and quarriers and builders of old had used; and at such work the dwarves
were still very skilled.</p>
<p>As they worked the ravens brought them constant tidings. In this way they
learned that the Elvenking had turned aside to the Lake, and they still had a
breathing space. Better still, they heard that three of their ponies had escaped
and were wandering wild far down the banks of the Running River, not far from
where the rest of their stores had been left. So while the others went on with
their work, Fili and Kili were sent, guided by a raven, to find the ponies and
bring back all they could.</p>
<p>They were four days gone, and by that time they knew that the joined armies
of the Lake-men and the Elves were hurrying towards the Mountain. But now their
hopes were higher; for they had food for some weeks with care-chiefly cram, of
course, and they were very tired of it; but cram is much better than nothing-and
already the gate was blocked with a wall of squared stones laid dry, but very
thick and high across the opening. There were holes in the wall through which
they could see (or shoot) but no entrance. They climbed in or out with ladders,
and hauled stuff up with ropes. For the issuing of the stream they had contrived
a small low arch under the new wall; but near the entrance they had so altered
the narrow bed that a wide pool stretched from the mountain-wall to the head of
the fall over which the stream went towards Dale. Approach to the Gate was now
only possible, without swimming, along a narrow ledge of the cliff, to the right
as one looked outwards from the wall. The ponies they had brought only to the
head of the steps above the old bridge, and unloading them there had bidden them
return to their masters and sent them back riderless to the South.</p>
<p>There came a night when suddenly there were many lights as of fires and
torches away south in Dale before them.</p>
<p>"They have come!" called Balin. "And their camp is very great.
They must have come into the valley under the cover of dusk along both banks of
the river."</p>
<p>That night the dwarves slept little. The morning was still pale when they saw
a company approaching. From behind their wall they watched them come up to the
valley's head and climb slowly up. Before long they could see that both men of
the lake armed as if for war and elvish bowmen were among them. At length the
foremost of these climbed the tumbled rocks and appeared at the top of the
falls; and very great was their surprise to see the pool before them and the
Gate blocked with a wall of new-hewn stone.</p>
<p>As they stood pointing and speaking to one another Thorin hailed them:
"Who are you," he called in a very loud voice, "that come as if
in war to the gates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain, and what
do you desire?"</p>
<p>But they answered nothing. Some turned swiftly back, and the others after
gazing for a while at the Gate and its defences soon followed them. That day the
camp was moved and was brought right between the arms of the Mountain. The rocks
echoed then with voices and with song, as they had not done for many a day.
There was the sound, too, of elven-harps and of sweet music; and as it echoed up
towards them it seemed that the chill of the air was warmed, and they caught
faintly the fragrance of woodland flowers blossoming in spring.</p>
<p>Then Bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go down and join in
the mirth and feasting by the fires. Some of the younger dwarves were moved in
their hearts, too, and they muttered that they wished things had fallen out
otherwise and that they might welcome such folk as friends; but Thorin scowled.</p>
<p>Then the dwarves themselves brought forth harps and instruments regained from
the hoard, and made music to soften his mood; but their song was not as elvish
song, and was much like the song they had sung long before in Bilbo's little
hobbit-hole.</p>

</blockquote>
</i>
<p>This song appeared to please Thorin, and he smiled again and grew merry; and
he began reckoning the distance to the Iron Hills and how long it would be
before Dain could reach the Lonely Mountain, if he had set out as soon as the
message reached him. But Bilbo's heart fell, both at the song and the talk: they
sounded much too warlike. The next morning early a company of spearmen was seen
crossing the river, and marching up the valley. They bore with them the green
banner of the Elvenking and the blue banner of the Lake, and they advanced until
they stood right before the wall at the Gate.</p>
<p>Again Thorin hailed them in a loud voice: "Who are you that come armed
for war to the gates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain?"
This time he was answered.</p>
<p>A tall man stood forward, dark of hair and grim of face, and he cried:
"Hail Thorin! Why do you fence yourself like a robber in his hold? We are
not yet foes, and we rejoice that you are alive beyond our hope. We came
expecting to find none living here; yet now that we are met there is matter for
a parley and a council."</p>
<p>"Who are you, and of what would you parley?"</p>
<p>"I am Bard, and by my hand was the dragon slain and your treasure
delivered. Is that not a matter that concerns you? Moreover I am by right
descent the heir of Girion of Dale, and in your hoard is mingled much of the
wealth of his halls and town, which of old Smaug stole. Is not that a matter of
which we may speak? Further in his last battle Smaug destroyed the dwellings of
the men of Esgaroth, and I am yet the servant of their Master. I would speak for
him and ask whether you have no thought for the sorrow and misery of his people.
They aided you in your distress, and in recompense you have thus far brought
ruin only, though doubtless undesigned."</p>
<p>Now these were fair words and true, if proudly and grimly spoken; and Bilbo
thought that Thorin would at once admit what justice was in them. He did not, of
course, expect that any one would remember that it was he who discovered all by
himself the dragon's weak spot; and that was just as well, for no one ever did.
But also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon has
long brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts. Long hours in the past days Thorin had
spent in the treasury, and the lust of it was heavy on him. Though he had hunted
chiefly for the Arkenstone, yet he had an eye for many another wonderful thing
that was lying there, about which were wound old memories of the labours and the
sorrows of his race.</p>
<p>"You put your worst cause last and in the chief place," Thorin
answered. "To the treasure of my people no man has a claim, because Smaug
who stole it from us also robbed him of life or home. The treasure was not his
that his evil deeds should be amended with a share of it. The price of the goods
and the assistance that we received of the Lake-men we will fairly pay-in due
time. But nothing will we give, not even a loaf's worth, under threat of force.
While an armed host lies before our doors, we look on you as foes and thieves.</p>
<p>"It is in my mind to ask what share of their inheritance you would have
paid to our kindred, had you found the hoard unguarded and us slain."</p>
<p>"A just question," replied Bard. "But you are not dead, and we
are not robbers. Moreover the wealthy may have pity beyond right on the needy
that befriended them when they were in want. And still my other claims remain
unanswered."</p>
<p>"I will not parley, as I have said, with armed men at my gate. Nor at
all with the people of the Elvenking, whom I remember with small kindness. In
this debate they have no place. Begone now ere our arrows fly! And if you would
speak with me again, first dismiss the elvish host to the woods where it
belongs, and then return, laying down your arms before you approach the
threshold."</p>
<p>"The Elvenking is my friend, and he has succoured the people of the Lake
in their need, though they had no claim but friendship on him," answered
Bard. "We will give you time to repent your words. Gather your wisdom ere
we return!" Then he departed and went back to the camp.</p>
<p>Ere many hours were past, the banner-bearers returned, and trumpeters stood
forth and blew a blast:</p>
<p>"In the name of Esgaroth and the Forest," one cried, "we speak
unto Thorin Thrain's son Oakenshield, calling himself the King under the
Mountain, and we bid him consider well the claims that have been urged, or be
declared our foe. At the least he shall deliver one twelfth portion of the
treasure unto Bard, as the dragon-slayer, and as the heir of Girion. From that
portion Bard will himself contribute to the aid of Esgaroth; but if Thorin would
have the friendship and honour of the lands about, as his sires had of old, then
he will give also somewhat of his own for the comfort of the men of the
Lake." Then Thorin seized a bow of horn and shot an arrow at the speaker.
It smote into his shield and stuck there quivering.</p>
<p>'"Since such is your answer," he called in return, "I declare
the Mountain besieged. You shall not depart from it, until you call on your side
for a truce and a parley. We will bear no weapons against you, but we leave you
to your gold. You may eat that, if you will!"</p>
<p>With that the messengers departed swiftly, and the dwarves were left to
consider their case. So grim had Thorin become, that even if they had wished,
the others would not have dared to find fault with him; but indeed most of them
seemed to share his mind-except perhaps old fat Bombur and Fili and Kili. Bilbo,
of course, disapproved of the whole turn of affairs. He had by now had more than
enough of the Mountain, and being besieged inside it was not at all to his
taste.</p>
<p>"The whole place still stinks of dragon," he grumbled to himself,
"and it makes me sick. And cram is beginning simply to stick in my
throat."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="16"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 16</h2>
<h2>A Thief in the Night</h2>
<p>Now the days passed slowly and wearily. Many of the dwarves spent their time
piling and ordering the treasure; and now Thorin spoke of the Arkenstone of
Thrain, and bade them eagerly to look for it in every comer.</p>
<p>"For the Arkenstone of my father," he said, "is worth more
than a river of gold in itself, and to me it is beyond price. That stone of all
the treasure I name unto myself, and I will be avenged on anyone who finds it
and withholds it."</p>
<p>Bilbo heard these words and he grew afraid, wondering what would happen, if
the stone was found-wrapped in an old bundle of tattered oddments that he used
as a pillow. All the same he did not speak of it, for as the weariness of the
days grew heavier, the beginnings of a plan had come into his little head.</p>
<p>Things had gone on like this for some time, when the ravens brought news that
Dain and more than five hundred dwarves, hurrying from the Iron Hills, were now
within about two days' march of Dale, coming from the North-East.</p>
<p>"But they cannot reach the Mountain unmarked," said Roac, "and
I fear lest there be battle in the valley. I do not call this counsel good.
Though they are a grim folk, they are not likely to overcome the host that
besets you; and even if they did so, what will you gain? Winter and snow is
hastening behind them. How shall you be fed without the friendship and goodwill
of the lands about you? The treasure is likely to be your death, though the
dragon is no more!"'</p>
<p>But Thorin was not moved. "Winter and snow will bite both men and
elves," he said, "and they may find their dwelling in the Waste
grievous to bear. With my friends behind them and winter upon them, they will
perhaps be in softer mood to parley with."</p>
<p>That night Bilbo made up his mind. The sky was black and moonless. As soon as
it was full dark, he went to a corner of an inner chamber just within the gate
and drew from his bundle a rope, and also the Arkenstone wrapped in a rag. Then
he climbed to the top of the wall. Only Bombur was there, for it was his turn to
watch, and the dwarves kept only one watchman at a time.</p>
<p>"It is mighty cold!" said Bombur. "I wish we could have a fire
up here as they have in the camp!"</p>
<p>"It is warm enough inside," said Bilbo.</p>
<p>"I daresay; but I am bound here till midnight," grumbled the fat
dwarf. "A sorry business altogether. Not that I venture to disagree with
Thorin, may his beard grow ever longer; yet he was ever a dwarf with a stiff
neck."</p>
<p>"Not as stiff as my legs," said Bilbo. "I am tired of stairs
and stone passages. I would give a good deal for the feel of grass at my
toes."</p>
<p>"I would give a good deal for the feel of a strong drink in my throat,
and for a soft bed after a good supper!"</p>
<p>"I can't give you those, while the siege is going on. But it is long
since I watched, and I will take your turn for you, if you like. There is no
sleep in me tonight."</p>
<p>"You are a good fellow, Mr. Baggins, and I will take your offer kindly.
If there should be anything to note, rouse me first, mind you! I will lie in the
inner chamber to the left, not far away."</p>
<p>"Off you go!" said Bilbo. "I will wake you at midnight, and
you can wake the next watchman." As soon as Bombur had gone, Bilbo put on
his ring, fastened his rope, slipped down over the wall, and was gone. He had
about five hours before him. Bombur would sleep (he could sleep at any time, and
ever since the adventure in the forest he was always trying to recapture the
beautiful dreams he had then); and all the others were busy with Thorin. It was
unlikely that any, even Fili or Kili, would come out on the wall until it was
their turn. It was very dark, and the road after a while, when he left the newly
made path and climbed down towards the lower course of the stream, was strange
to him. At last he came to the bend where he had to cross the water, if he was
to make for the camp, as he wished. The bed of the stream was there shallow but
already broad, and fording it in the dark was not easy for the little hobbit. He
was nearly across when he missed his footing on a round stone and fell into the
cold water with a splash. He had barely scrambled out on the far bank, shivering
and spluttering, when up came elves in the gloom with bright lanterns and
searched for the cause of the noise.</p>
<p>"That was no fish!" one said. "There is a spy about. Hide your
lights! They will help him more than us, if it is that queer little creature
that is said to be their servant."</p>
<p>"Servant, indeed!" snorted Bilbo; and in the middle of his snort he
sneezed loudly, and the elves immediately gathered towards the sound.</p>
<p>"Let's have a light!" he said. "I am here, if you want
me!" and he slipped off his ring, and popped from behind a rock.</p>
<p>They seized him quickly, in spite of their surprise. "Who are you? Are
you the dwarves' hobbit? What are you doing? How did you get so far past our
sentinels?" they asked one after another.</p>
<p>"I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins," he answered, "companion of Thorin,
if you want to know. I know your king well by sight, though perhaps he doesn't
know me to look at. But Bard will remember me, and it is Bard I particularly
want to see."</p>
<p>"Indeed!" said they, "and what may be your business?"</p>
<p>"Whatever it is, it's my own, my good elves. But if you wish ever to get
back to your own woods from this cold cheerless place," he answered
shivering, "you will take me along quiet to a fire, where I can dry-and
then you will let me speak to your chiefs as quick as may be. I have only an
hour or two to spare."</p>
<p>That is how it came about that some two hours after his escape from the Gate,
Bilbo was sitting beside a warm fire in front of a large tent, and there sat
too, gazing curiously at him, both the Elvenking and Bard. A hobbit in elvish
armour, partly wrapped in an old blanket, was something new to them.</p>
<p>"Really you know," Bilbo was saying in his best business manner,
"things are impossible. Personally I am tired of the whole affair. I wish I
was back in the West in my own home, where folk are more reasonable. But I have
an interest in this matter-one fourteenth share, to be precise, according to a
letter, which fortunately I believe I have kept." He drew from a pocket in
his old jacket (which he still wore over his mail), crumpled and much folded,
Thorin's letter that had been put under the clock on his mantelpiece in May!</p>
<p>"A share in the profits, mind you," he went on. "I am aware of
that. Personally I am only too ready to consider all your claims carefully, and
deduct what is right from the total before putting in my own claim. However you
don't know Thorin Oakenshield as well as I do now. I assure you, he is quite
ready to sit on a heap of gold and starve, as long as you sit here."</p>
<p>"Well, let him!" said Bard. "Such a fool deserves to
starve."</p>
<p>"Quite so," said Bilbo. "I see your point of view. At the same
time winter is coming on fast. Before long you will be having snow and what not,
and supplies will be difficult - even for elves I imagine. Also there will be
other difficulties. You have not heard of Dain and the dwarves of the Iron
Hills?"</p>
<p>"We have, a long time ago; but what has he got to do with us?"
asked the king.</p>
<p>"I thought as much. I see I have some information you have not got.
Dain, I may tell you, is now less than two days' march off, and has at least
five hundred grim dwarves with him - a good many of them have had experience in
the dreadful dwarf and goblin wars, of which you have no doubt heard. When they
arrive there may be serious trouble."</p>
<p>"Why do you tell us this? Are you betraying your friends, or are you
threatening us?" asked Bard grimly.</p>
<p>"My dear Bard!" squeaked Bilbo. "Don't be so hasty! I never
met such suspicious folk! I am merely trying to avoid trouble for all concerned.
Now I will make you an offer!!"</p>
<p>"Let us hear it!" they said.</p>
<p>"You may see it!" said he. "It is this!" and he drew
forth the Arkenstone, and threw away the wrapping.</p>
<p>The Elvenking himself, whose eyes were used to things of wonder and beauty,
stood up in amazement. Even Bard gazed marvelling at it in silence. It was as if
a globe had been filled with moonlight and hung before them in a net woven of
the glint of frosty stars.</p>
<p>"This is the Arkenstone of Thrain," said Bilbo, "the Heart of
the Mountain; and it is also the heart of Thorin. He values it above a river of
gold. I give it to you. It will aid you in your bargaining." Then Bilbo,
not without a shudder, not without a glance of longing, handed the marvellous
stone to Bard, and he held it in his hand, as though dazed.</p>
<p>"But how is it yours to give?" he asked at last with an effort.</p>
<p>"O well!" said the hobbit uncomfortably. "It isn't exactly;
but, well, I am willing to let it stand against all my claim, don't you know. I
may be a burglar-or so they say: personally I never really felt like one-but I
am an honest one, I hope, more or less. Anyway I am going back now, and the
dwarves can do what they like to me. I hope you will find it useful."</p>
<p>The Elvenking looked at Bilbo with a new wonder.</p>
<p>"Bilbo Baggins!" he said. "You are more worthy to wear the
armour of elf-princes than many that have looked more comely in it. But I wonder
if Thorin Oakenshield will see it so. I have more knowledge of dwarves in
general than you have perhaps. I advise you to remain with us, and here you
shall be honoured and thrice welcome."</p>
<p>"Thank you very much I am sure," said Bilbo with a bow. "But I
don't think I ought to leave my friends like this, after all we have gone
through together. And I promised to wake old Bombur at midnight, too! Really I
must be going, and quickly."</p>
<p>Nothing they could say would stop him; so an escort was provided for him, and
as he went both the king and Bard saluted him with honour. As they passed
through the camp an old man wrapped in a dark cloak, rose from a tent door where
he was sitting and came towards them.</p>
<p>"Well done! Mr. Baggins!" he said, clapping Bilbo on the back.
"There is always more about you than anyone expects!" It was Gandalf.</p>
<p>For the first time for many a day Bilbo was really delighted. But there was
no time for all the questions that he immediately wished to ask.</p>
<p>"All in good time!" said Gandalf. "Things are drawing towards
the end now, unless I am mistaken. There is an unpleasant time just in front of
you; but keep your heart up! You may come through all right. There is news
brewing that even the ravens have not heard. Good night!"</p>
<p>Puzzled but cheered. Bilbo hurried on. He was guided to a safe ford and set
across dry, and then he said farewell to the elves and climbed carefully back
towards the Gate. Great weariness began to come over him; but it was well before
midnight when he clambered up the rope again - it was still where he had left
it. He untied it and hid it, and then he sat down on the wall and wondered
anxiously what would happen next.</p>
<p>At midnight he woke up Bombur; and then in turn rolled himself up in his
corner, without listening to old dwarfs thanks (which he felt he had hardly
earned). He was soon fast asleep forgetting all his worries till the morning. As
matter of fact he was dreaming of eggs and bacon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="17"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 17</h2>
<h2>The Clouds Burst</h2>
<p>Next day the trumpets rang early in the camp. Soon a single runner was seen
hurrying along the narrow path. At a distance he stood and hailed them, asking
whether Thorin would now listen to another embassy, since new tidings had come
to hand, and matters were changed.</p>
<p>"That will be Dain!" said Thorin when he heard. "They will
have got wind of his coming. I thought that would alter their mood! Bid them
come few in number and weaponless, and I will hear," he called to the
messenger.</p>
<p>About midday the banners of the Forest and the Lake were seen to be borne
forth again. A company of twenty was approaching. At the beginning of the narrow
way they laid aside sword and spear, and came on towards the Gate. Wondering,
the dwarves saw that among them were both Bard and the Elvenking, before whom an
old man wrapped in cloak and hood bore a strong casket of iron-bound wood.</p>
<p>"Hail Thorin!" said Bard. "Are you still of the same
mind?"</p>
<p>"My mind does not change with the rising and setting of a few
suns," answered Thorin. "Did you come to ask me idle questions? Still
the elf-host has not departed as I bade! Till then you come in vain to bargain
with me." "Is there then nothing for which you would yield any of your
gold?"</p>
<p>"Nothing that you or your friends have to offer."</p>
<p>"What of the Arkenstone of Thrain?" said he, and at the same moment
the old man opened the casket and held aloft the jewel. The light leapt from his
hand, bright and white in the morning.</p>
<p>Then Thorin was stricken dumb with amazement and confusion. No one spoke for
a long while. Thorin at length broke the silence, and his voice was thick with
wrath. "That stone was my father's, and is mine," he said. "Why
should I purchase my own?" But wonder overcame him and he added: "But
how came you by the heirloom of my house-if there is need to ask such a question
of thieves?"</p>
<p>"We are not thieves," Bard answered. "Your own we will give
back in return for our own."</p>
<p>'How came you by it?" shouted Thorin in gathering rage.</p>
<p>"I gave it them!" squeaked Bilbo, who was peeping over the wall, by
now, in a dreadful fright.</p>
<p>"You! You!" cried Thorin, turning upon him and grasping him with
both hands. "You miserable hobbit! You undersized-burglar!" he shouted
at a loss for words, and he shook poor Bilbo like a rabbit.</p>
<p>"By the beard of Durin! I wish I had Gandalf here! Curse him for his
choice of you! May his beard wither! As for you I will throw you to the
rocks!" he cried and lifted Bilbo in his arms.</p>
<p>"Stay! Your wish is granted!" said a voice. The old man with the
casket threw aside his hood and cloak. "Here is Gandalf! And none too soon
it seems. If you don't like my Burglar, please don't damage him. Put him down,
and listen first to what he has to say!"</p>
<p>"You all seem in league!" said Thorin dropping Bilbo on the top of
the wall. "Never again will I have dealings with any wizard or his friends.
What have you to say, you descendant of rats?"</p>
<p>"Dear me! Dear me!" said Bilbo. "I am sure this is all very
uncomfortable. You may remember saying that I might choose my own fourteenth
share? Perhaps I took it too literally -1 have been told that dwarves are
sometimes politer in word than in deed. The time was, all the same, when you
seemed to think that I had been of some service. Descendant of rats, indeed! Is
this ail the service of you and your family that I was promised. Thorin? Take it
that I have disposed of my share as I wished, and let it go at that!"</p>
<p>"I will," said Thorin grimly. "And I will let you go at
that-and may we never meet again!" Then he turned and spoke over the wall.
"I am betrayed," he said. "It was rightly guessed that I could
not forbear to redeem the Arkenstone, the treasure of my house. For it I will
give one fourteenth share of the hoard in silver and gold, setting aside the
gems; but that shall be accounted the promised share of this traitor, and with
that reward he shall depart, and you can divide it as you will. He will get
little enough, I doubt not. Take him, if you wish him to live; and no friendship
of mine goes with him.</p>
<p>"Get down now to your friends!" he said to Bilbo, "or I will
throw you down."</p>
<p>"What about the gold and silver?" asked Bilbo.</p>
<p>"That shall follow after, as can be arranged," said he.</p>
<p>"Get down!"</p>
<p>"Until then we keep the stone," cried Bard.</p>
<p>"You are not making a very splendid figure as King under the
Mountain," said Gandalf. "But things may change yet."</p>
<p>"They may indeed," said Thorin. And already, so strong was the
bewilderment of the treasure upon him, he was pondering whether by the help of
Dain he might not recapture the Arkenstone and withhold the share of the reward.</p>
<p>And so Bilbo was swung down from the wall, and departed with nothing for all
his trouble, except the armour which Thorin had given him already. More than one
of the dwarves 'in their hearts felt shame and pity at his going.</p>
<p>"Farewell!" he cried to them. "We may meet again as
friends."</p>
<p>"Be off!" called Thorin. "You have mail upon you, which was
made by my folk, and is too good for you. It cannot be pierced .by arrows; but
if you do not hasten, I will sting your miserable feet. So be swift!"</p>
<p>"Not so hasty!" said Bard. "We will give you until tomorrow.
At noon we will return, and see if you have brought from the hoard the portion
that is to be set against the stone. If that is done without deceit, then we
will depart, and the elf-host will go back to the Forest. In the meanwhile
farewell!"</p>
<p>With that they went back to the camp; but Thorin sent messengers by Roac
telling Dain of what had passed, and bidding him come with wary speed.</p>
<p>That day passed and the night. The next day the wind shifted west, and the
air was dark and gloomy. The morning was still early when a cry was heard in the
camp. Runners came in to report that a host of dwarves had appeared round the
eastern spur of the Mountain and was now hastening to Dale. Dain had come. He
had hurried on through the night, and so had come upon them sooner than they had
expected. Each one of his folk was clad in a hauberk of steel mail that hung to
his knees, and his legs were covered with hose of a fine and flexible metal
mesh, the secret of whose making was possessed by Dain's people.</p>
<p>The dwarves are exceedingly strong for their height, but most of these were
strong even for dwarves. In battle they wielded heavy two-handed mattocks; but
each of them had also a short broad sword at his side and a round shield slung
at his back. Their beards were forked and plaited and thrust into their belts.
Their caps were of iron and they were shod with iron, and their faces were grim.
Trumpets called men and elves to arms. Before long the dwarves could be seen
coming up the valley at a great pace. They halted between the river and the
eastern spur; but a few held on their way, and crossing the river drew near the
camp; and there they laid down their weapons and held up their hands in sign of
peace. Bard went out to meet them, and with him went Bilbo.</p>
<p>"We are sent from Dain son of Nain," they said when questioned.
"We are hastening to our kinsmen in the Mountain, since we learn that the
kingdom of old is renewed. But who are you that sit in the plain as foes before
defended walls?" This, of. course, in the polite and rather old-fashioned
language of such occasions, meant simply: "You have no business here. We
are going on, so make way or we shall fight you!" They meant to push on
between the Mountain and the loop of the river, for the narrow land there did
not seem to be strongly guarded.</p>
<p>Bard, of course, refused to allow the dwarves to go straight on to the
Mountain. He was determined to wait until the gold and silver had been brought
out in exchange for the Arkenstone: for he did not believe that this would be
done, if once the fortress was manned with so large and warlike a company. They
had brought with them a great store of supplies; for the dwarves can carry very
heavy burdens, and nearly all of Dain's folks, in spite of their rapid march,
bore huge packs on their backs in addition to their weapons. They would stand a
siege for weeks, and by that time yet more dwarves might come, and yet more, for
Thorin had many relatives. Also they would be able to reopen and guard some
other gate, so that the besiegers would have to encircle the whole mountain; and
for that they had not sufficient numbers.</p>
<p>These were, in fact, precisely their plans (for the raven-messengers had been
busy between Thorin and Dain); but for the moment the way was barred, so after
angry words the dwarf-messengers retired muttering in their beards. Bard then
sent messengers at once to the Gate; but they found no gold or payment. Arrows
came forth as soon as they were within shot, and they hastened back in dismay.
In the camp all was now astir, as if for battle; for the dwarves of Dain were
advancing along the eastern bank.</p>
<p>"Fools!" laughed Bard, "to come thus beneath the Mountain's
arm! They do not understand war above ground, whatever they may know of battle
in the mines. There are many of our archers and spearmen now hidden in the rocks
upon their right flank. Dwarf-mail may be good, but they will soon be hard put
to it. Let us set on them now from both sides, before they are fully
rested!"</p>
<p>But the Elvenking said: "Long will I tarry, ere I begin this war for
gold. The dwarves cannot press us, unless we will, or do anything that we cannot
mark. Let us hope still for something that will bring reconciliation. Our
advantage in numbers will be enough, if in the end it must come to unhappy
blows."</p>
<p>But he reckoned without the dwarves. The knowledge that the Arkenstone was in
the hands of the besiegers burned in their thoughts; also they guessed the
hesitation of Bard and his friends, and resolved to strike while they debated.</p>
<p>Suddenly without a signal they sprang silently forward to attack. Bows
twanged and arrows whistled; battle was about to be joined.</p>
<p>Still more suddenly a darkness came on with dreadful swiftness! A black cloud
hurried over the sky. Winter thunder on a wild wind rolled roaring up and
rumbled in the Mountain, and lightning lit its peak. And beneath the thunder
another blackness could be seen whirling forward; but it did not come with the
wind, it came from the North, like a vast cloud of birds, so dense that no light
could be seen between their wings.</p>
<p>"Halt!" cried Gandalf, who appeared suddenly, and stood alone, with
arms uplifted, between the advancing dwarves and the ranks awaiting them.
"Halt!" he called in a voice like thunder, and his staff blazed forth
with a flash like the lightning. "Dread has come upon you all! Alas! it has
come more swiftly than I guessed. The Goblins are upon you! Bolg<font face="Symbol">*</font>
of the North is coming. O Dain! whose father you slew in Moria. Behold! the bats
are above his army like a sea of locusts. They ride upon wolves and Wargs are in
their train!"</p>
<p>Amazement and confusion fell upon them all. Even as Gandalf had been speaking
the darkness grew. The dwarves halted and gazed at the sky. The elves cried out
with many voices.</p>
<p>"Come!" called Gandalf. "There is yet time for council. Let
Dain son of Nain come swiftly to us!"</p>
<p>So began a battle that none had expected; and it was called the Battle of
Five Armies, and it was very terrible. Upon one side were the Goblins and the
wild Wolves, and upon the other were Elves and Men and Dwarves. This is how it
fell out. Ever since the fall of the Great Goblin of the Misty Mountains the
hatred of their race for the dwarves had been rekindled to fury. Messengers had
passed to and fro between all their cities, colonies and strongholds; for they
resolved now to win the dominion of the North. Tidings they had gathered in
secret ways; and in all the mountains there was a forging and an arming. Then
they marched and gathered by hill and valley, going ever by tunnel or under
dark, until around and beneath the great mountain Gundabad of the North, where
was their capital, a vast host was assembled ready to sweep down in time of
storm unawares upon the South. Then they learned of the death of Smaug, and joy
was in their hearts: and they hastened night after night through the mountains,
and came thus at last on a sudden from the North hard on the heels of Dain. Not
even the ravens knew of their coming until they came out in the broken lands
which divided the Lonely Mountain from the hills behind. How much Gandalf knew
cannot be said, but it is plain that he had not expected this sudden assault.</p>
<p>This is the plan that he made in council with the Elvenking and with Bard;
and with Dain, for the dwarf-lord now joined them: the Goblins were the foes of
all, and at their coming all other quarrels were forgotten. Their only hope was
to lure the goblins into the valley between the arms of the Mountain; and
themselves to man the great spurs that struck south and east. Yet this would be
perilous, if the goblins were in sufficient numbers to overrun the Mountain
itself, and so attack them also from behind and above; but there was no time for
make any other plan, or to summon any help.</p>
<p>Soon the thunder passed, rolling away to the South-East; but the bat-cloud
came, flying lower, over the shoulder of the Mountain, and whirled above them
shutting out the light and filling them with dread.</p>
<p>"To the Mountain!" called Bard. "To the Mountain! Let us take
our places while there is yet time!"</p>
<p>On the Southern spur, in its lower slopes and in the rocks at its feet, the
Elves were set; on the Eastern spur were men and dwarves. But Bard and some of
the nimblest of men and elves climbed to the height of the Eastern shoulder to
gain a view to the North. Soon they could see the lands before the Mountain's
feet black with a hurrying multitude. Ere long the vanguard swirled round the
spur's end and came rushing into Dale. These were the swiftest wolf-riders, and
already their cries and howls rent the air afar. A few brave men were strung
before them to make a feint of resistance, and many there fell before the rest
drew back and fled to either side. As Gandalf had hoped, the goblin army had
gathered behind the resisted vanguard, and poured now in rage into the valley,
driving wildly up between the arms of the Mountain, seeking for the foe. Their
banners were countless, black and red, and they came on like a tide in fury and
disorder.</p>
<p>It was a terrible battle. The most dreadful of all Bilbo's experiences, and
the one which at the time he hated most - which is to say it was the one he was
most proud of, and most fond of recalling long afterwards, although he was quite
unimportant in it. Actually I must say he put on his ring early in the business,
and vanished from sight, if not from all danger. A magic ring of that sort is
not a complete protection in a goblin charge, nor does it stop flying arrows and
wild spears; but it does help in getting out of the way, and it prevents your
head from being specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a goblin swordsman.</p>
<p>The elves were the first to charge. Their hatred for the goblins is cold and
bitter. Their spears and swords shone in the gloom with a gleam of chill flame,
so deadly was the wrath of the hands that held them. As soon as the host of
their enemies was dense in the valley, they sent against it a shower of arrows,
and each flickered as it fled as if with stinging fire. Behind the arrows a
thousand of their spearmen leapt down and charged. The yells were deafening. The
rocks were stained black with goblin blood. Just as the goblins were recovering
from the onslaught and the elf-charge was halted, there rose from across the
valley a deep-throated roar. With cries of "Moria!" and "Dain,
Dain!" the dwarves of the Iron Hills plunged in, wielding their mattocks,
upon the other side; and beside them came the men of the Lake with long swords.
Panic came upon the Goblins; and even as they turned to meet this new attack,
the elves charged again with renewed numbers. Already many of the goblins were
flying back down the river to escape from the trap: and many of their own wolves
were turning upon them and rending the dead and the wounded. Victory seemed at
hand, when a cry rang out on the heights above.</p>
<p>Goblins had scaled the Mountain from the other side and already many were on
the slopes above the Gate, and others were streaming down recklessly, heedless
of those that fell screaming from cliff and precipice, to attack the spurs from
above. Each of these could be reached by paths that ran down from the main mass
of the Mountain in the centre; and the defenders had too few to bar the way for
long. Victory now vanished from hope. They had only stemmed the first onslaught
of the black tide.</p>
<p>Day drew on. The goblins gathered again in the valley. There a host of Wargs
came ravening and with them came the bodyguard of Bolg, goblins of huge size
with scimitars of steel. Soon actual darkness was coming into a stormy sky;
while still the great bats swirled about the heads and ears of elves and men, or
fastened vampire-like on the stricken. Now Bard was fighting to defend the
Eastern spur, and yet giving slowly back; and the elf-lords were at bay about
their king upon the southern arm, near to the watch-post on Ravenhill.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a great shout, and from the Gate came a trumpet call. They
had forgotten Thorin! Part of the wall, moved by levers, fell outward with a
crash into the pool. Out leapt the King under the Mountain, and his companions
followed him. Hood and cloak were gone; they were in shining armour, and red
light leapt from their eyes. In the gloom the great dwarf gleamed like gold in a
dying fire.</p>
<p>Rocks were buried down from on high by the goblins above; but they held on.
leapt down to the falls' foot, and rushed forward to battle. Wolf and rider fell
or fled before them. Thorin wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and nothing
seemed to harm him.</p>
<p>"To me! To me! Elves and Men! To me! O my kinsfolk!" he cried, and
his voice shook like a horn in the valley.</p>
<p>Down, heedless of order, rushed all the dwarves of Dain to his help. Down too
came many of the Lake-men, for Bard could not restrain them; and out upon the
other side came many of the spearmen of the elves. Once again the goblins were
stricken in the valley; and they were piled in heaps till Dale was dark and
hideous with their corpses. The Wargs were scattered and Thorin drove right
against the bodyguards of Bolg. But he could not pierce their ranks. Already
behind him among the goblin dead lay many men and many dwarves, and many a fair
elf that should have lived yet long ages merrily in the wood. And as the valley
widened his onset grew ever slower. His numbers were too few. His flanks were
unguarded. Soon the attackers were attacked, and they were forced into a great
ring, facing every way, hemmed all about with goblins and wolves returning to
the assault. The bodyguard of Bolg came howling against them, and drove in upon
their ranks like waves upon cliffs of sand. Their friends could not help them,
for the assault from the Mountain was renewed with redoubled force, and upon
either side men and elves were being slowly beaten down.</p>
<p>On all this Bilbo looked with misery. He had taken his stand on Ravenhill
among the Elves-partly because there was more chance of escape from that point,
and partly (with the more Tookish part of his mind) because if he was going to
be in a last desperate stand, he preferred on the whole to defend the Elvenking.
Gandalf, too, I may say, was there, sitting on the ground as if in deep thought,
preparing, I suppose, some last blast of magic before the end. That did not seem
far off. "It will not be long now," thought Bilbo, "before the
goblins win the Gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down and captured.
Really it is enough to make one weep, after all one has gone through. I would
rather old Smaug had been left with all the wretched treasure, than that these
vile creatures should get it, and poor old Bombur, and Balin and Fili and Kili
and all the rest come to a bad end; and Bard too, and the Lake-men and the merry
elves. Misery me! I have heard songs of many battles, and I have always
understood that defeat may be glorious. It seems very uncomfortable, not to say
distressing. I wish I was well out of it."</p>
<p>The clouds were torn by the wind, and a red sunset slashed the West. Seeing
the sudden gleam in the gloom Bilbo looked round. He gave a great cry: he had
seen a sight that made his heart leap, dark shapes small yet majestic against
the distant glow.</p>
<p>"The Eagles! The Eagles!" he shouted. "The Eagles are
coming!"</p>
<p>Bilbo's eyes were seldom wrong. The eagles were coming down the wind, line
after line, in such a host as must have gathered from all the eyries of the
North.</p>
<p>"The Eagles! the Eagles!" Bilbo cried, dancing and waving his arms.
If the elves could not see him they could hear him. Soon they too took up the
cry, and it echoed across the valley. Many wondering eyes looked up, though as
yet nothing could be seen except from the southern shoulders of the Mountain.</p>
<p>"The Eagles!" cried Bilbo once more, but at that moment a stone
hurtling from above smote heavily on his helm, and he fell with a crash and knew
no more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="18"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 18</h2>
<h2>The Return Journey</h2>
<p>When Bilbo came to himself, he was literally by himself. He was lying on the
flat stones of Ravenhill, and no one was near. A cloudless day, but cold, was
broad above him. He was shaking, and as chilled as stone, but his head burned
with fire.</p>
<p>"Now I wonder what has happened?" he said to himself. "At any
rate I am not yet one of the fallen heroes; but I suppose there is still time
enough for that!"</p>
<p>He sat up painfully. Looking into the valley he could see no living goblins.
After a while as his head cleared a little, he thought he could see elves moving
in the rocks below. He rubbed his eyes. Surely there was a camp still in the
plain some distance off; and there was a coming and going about the Gate?
Dwarves seemed to be busy removing the wall. But all was deadly still. There was
no call and no echo of a song. Sorrow seemed to be in the air. "Victory
after all, I suppose!" he said, feeling his aching head. "Well, it
seems a very gloomy business."</p>
<p>Suddenly he was aware of a man climbing up and coming towards him.</p>
<p>"Hullo there!" he called with a shaky voice. "Hullo there!
What news?"</p>
<p>"What voice is it that speaks among the stones?" said the man
halting and peering about him not far from where Bilbo sat.</p>
<p>Then Bilbo remembered his ring! "Well I'm blessed!" said he.
"This invisibility has its drawbacks after all. Otherwise I suppose I might
have spent a warm and comfortable night in bed!"</p>
<p>"It's me, Bilbo Baggins, companion of Thorin!" he cried, hurriedly
taking off the ring.</p>
<p>"It is well that I have found you!" said the man striding forward.
"You are needed and we have looked for you long. You would have been
numbered among the dead, who are many, if Gandalf the wizard had not said that
your voice was last heard in this place. I have been sent to look here for the
last time. Are you much hurt?"</p>
<p>"A nasty knock on the head, I think," said Bilbo. "But I have
a helm and a hard skull. All the same I feel sick and my legs are like
straws."</p>
<p>"I will carry you down to the camp in the valley," said the man,
and picked him lightly up.</p>
<p>The man was swift and sure-footed. It was not long before Bilbo was set down
before a tent in Dale; and there stood Gandalf, with his arm in a sling. Even
the wizard had not escaped without a wound; and there were few unharmed in all
the host.</p>
<p>When Gandalf saw Bilbo, he was delighted. "Baggins!" he exclaimed.
"Well I never! Alive after all - 1 am glad! I began to wonder if even your
luck would see you through! A terrible business, and it nearly was disastrous.
But other news can wait. Come!" he said more gravely. "You are called
for;" and leading the hobbit he took him within the tent.</p>
<p>"Hail! Thorin," he said as he entered. "I have brought
him."</p>
<p>There indeed lay Thorin Oakenshield, wounded with many wounds, and his rent
armour and notched axe were cast upon the floor. He looked up as Bilbo came
beside him.</p>
<p>"Farewell, good thief," he said. "I go now to the halls of
waiting to sit beside my fathers, until the world is renewed. Since I leave now
all gold and silver, and go where it is of little worth, I wish to part in
friendship from you, and I would take back my words and deeds at the Gate."</p>
<p>Bilbo knelt on one knee filled with sorrow. "Farewell, King under the
Mountain!" he said. "This is a bitter adventure, if it must end so;
and not a mountain of gold can amend it. Yet I am glad that I have shared in
your perils - that has been more than any Baggins deserves."</p>
<p>"No!" said Thorin. "There is more in you of good than you
know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in
measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it
would be a merrier world. But sad or merry, I must leave it now. Farewell!"</p>
<p>Then Bilbo turned away, and he went by himself, and sat alone wrapped in a
blanket, and, whether you believe it or not, he wept until his eyes were red and
his voice was hoarse. He was a kindly little soul. Indeed it was long before he
had the heart to make a joke again. "A mercy it is," he said at last
to himself, "that I woke up when I did. I wish Thorin were living, but I am
glad that we parted in kindness. You are a fool, Bilbo Baggins, and you made a
great mess of that business with the stone; and there was a battle, in spite of
all your efforts to buy peace and quiet, but I suppose you can hardly be blamed
for that."</p>
<p>All that had happened after he was stunned, Bilbo learned later; but it gave
him more sorrow than joy, and he was now weary of his adventure. He was aching
in his bones for the homeward journey. That, however, was a little delayed, so
in the meantime I will tell something of events. The Eagles had long had
suspicion of the goblins' mustering; from their watchfulness the movements in
the mountains could not be altogether hid. So they too had gathered in great
numbers, under the great Eagle of the Misty Mountains; and at length smelling
battle from afar they had come speeding down the gale in the nick of time. They
it was who dislodged the goblins from the mountain-slopes, casting them over
precipices, or driving them down shrieking and bewildered among their foes. It
was not long before they had freed the Lonely Mountain, and elves and men on
either side of the valley could come at last to the help of the battle below.</p>
<p>But even with the Eagles they were still outnumbered.</p>
<p>In that last hour Beorn himself had appeared - no one knew how or from where.
He came alone, and in bear's shape; and he seemed to have grown almost to
giant-size in his wrath. The roar of his voice was like drums and guns; and he
tossed wolves and goblins from his path like straws and feathers. He fell upon
their rear, and broke like a clap of thunder through the ring. The dwarves were
making a stand still about their lords upon a low rounded hill. Then Beorn
stooped and lifted Thorin, who had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him out
of the fray. Swiftly he returned and his wrath was redoubled, so that nothing
could withstand him, and no weapon seemed to bite upon him. He scattered the
bodyguard, and pulled down Bolg himself and crushed him. Then dismay fell on the
Goblins and they fled in all directions. But weariness left their enemies with
the coming of new hope, and they pursued them closely, and prevented most of
them from escaping where they could. They drove many of them into the Running
River, and such as fled south or west they hunted into the marshes about the
Forest River; and there the greater part of the last fugitives perished, while
those that came hardly to the Wood-elves' realm were there slain, or drawn in to
die in the trackless dark of Mirkwood. Songs have said that three parts of the
goblin warriors of the North perished on that day, and the mountains had peace
for many a year.</p>
<p>Victory had been assured before the fall of night, but the pursuit was still
on foot, when Bilbo returned to the camp; and not many were in the valley save
the more grievously wounded.</p>
<p>"Where are the Eagles?" he asked Gandalf that evening, as he lay
wrapped in many warm blankets.</p>
<p>"Some are in the hunt," said the wizard, "but most have gone
back to their eyries. They would not stay here, and departed with the first
light of morning. Dain has crowned their chief with gold, and sworn friendship
with them for ever."</p>
<p>"I am sorry. I mean, I should have liked to see them again," said
Bilbo sleepily; "perhaps I shall see them on the way home. I suppose I
shall be going home soon?"</p>
<p>"As soon as you like," said the wizard.</p>
<p>Actually it was some days before Bilbo really set out.</p>
<p>They buried Thorin deep beneath the Mountain, and Bard laid the Arkenstone
upon his breast.</p>
<p>"There let it lie till the Mountain falls!" he said. "May it
bring good fortune to all his folk that dwell here after!" Upon his tomb
the Elvenking then laid Orcrist, the elvish sword that had been taken from
Thorin in captivity. It is said in songs that it gleamed ever in the dark if
foes approached, and the fortress of the dwarves could not be taken by surprise.
There now Dain son of Nain took up his abode, and he became King under the
Mountain, and in time many other dwarves gathered to his throne in the ancient
halls. Of the twelve companions of Thorin, ten remained. Fili and Kili had
fallen defending him with shield and body, for he was their mother's elder
brother. The others remained with Dain; for Dain dealt his treasure well. There
was, of course, no longer any question of dividing the hoard in such shares as
had been planned, to Balin and Dwalin, and Dori and Nori and Ori, and Oin and
Gloin, and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur-or to Bilbo. Yet a fourteenth share of all
the silver and gold, wrought and unwrought, was given up to Bard; for Dain said:
"We will honour the agreement of the dead, and he has now the Arkenstone in
his keeping."</p>
<p>Even a fourteenth share was wealth exceedingly great, greater than that of
many mortal kings. From that treasure Bard sent much gold to the Master of
Lake-town; and he rewarded his followers and friends freely. To the Elvenking he
gave the emeralds of Girion, such jewels as he most loved, which Dain had
restored to him. To Bilbo he said: "This treasure is as much yours as it is
mine; though old agreements cannot stand, since so many have a claim in its
winning and defence. Yet even though you were willing to lay aside all your
claim, I should wish that the words of Thorin, of which he repented, should not
prove true: that we should give you little. I would reward you most richly of
all."</p>
<p>"Very kind of you," said Bilbo. "But really it is a relief to
me. How on earth should I have got all that treasure home without war and murder
all along the way, I don't know. And I don't know what I should have done with
it when I got home. I am sure it is better in your hands."</p>
<p>In the end he would only take two small chests, one filled with silver, and
the other with gold, such as one strong pony could carry. "That will be
quite as much as I can manage," said he.</p>
<p>At last the time came for him to say good-bye to his friends. "Farewell,
Balin!" he said; "and farewell, Dwalin; and farewell Dori, Nori, Ori,
Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur! May your beards never grow thin!" And
turning towards the Mountain he added: "Farewell Thorin Oakenshield! And
Fili and Kili! May your memory never fade!"</p>
<p>Then the dwarves bowed low before their Gate, but words stuck in their
throats. "Good-bye and good luck, wherever you fare!" said Balin at
last. "If ever you visit us again, when our halls are made fair once more,
then the feast shall indeed be splendid!"</p>
<p>"If ever you are passing my way," said Bilbo, "don't wait to
knock! Tea is at four; but any of you are welcome at any time!"</p>
<p>Then he turned away.</p>
<p>The elf-host was on the march;. and if it was sadly lessened, yet many were
glad, for now the northern world would be merrier for many a long day. The
dragon was dead, and the goblins overthrown, and their hearts looked forward
after winter to a spring of joy. Gandalf and Bilbo rode behind the Elvenking,
and beside them strode Beorn, once again in man's shape, and he laughed and sang
in a loud voice upon the road. So they went on until they drew near to the
borders of Mirkwood, to the north of the place where the Forest River ran out.</p>
<p>Then they halted, for the wizard and Bilbo would not enter the wood, even
though the king bade them stay a while in his halls. They intended to go along
the edge of the forest, and round its northern end in the waste that lay between
it and the beginning of the Grey Mountains. It was a long and cheerless road,
but now that the goblins were crushed, it seemed safer to them than the dreadful
pathways under the trees. Moreover Beorn was going that way too.</p>
<p>"Farewell! O Elvenking!" said Gandalf. "Merry be the
greenwood, while the world is yet young! And merry be all your folk!"</p>
<p>"Farewell! O Gandalf!" said the king. "May you ever appear
where you are most needed and least expected! The oftener you appear in my halls
the better shall I be pleased!"</p>
<p>"I beg of you," said Bilbo stammering and standing on one foot,
"to accept this gift!" and he brought out a necklace of silver and
pearls that Dain had given him at their parting.</p>
<p>"In what way have I earned such a gift, O hobbit?" said the king.</p>
<p>"Well, er, I thought, don't you know," said Bilbo rather confused,
"that, er, some little return should be made for your, er, hospitality. I
mean even a burglar has his feelings. I have drunk much of your wine and eaten
much of your bread."</p>
<p>"I will take your gift, O Bilbo the Magnificent!" said the king
gravely. "And I name you elf-friend and blessed. May your shadow never grow
less (or stealing would be too easy)! Farewell!"</p>
<p>Then the elves turned towards the Forest, and Bilbo started on his long road
home.</p>
<p>He had many hardships and adventures before he got back. The Wild was still
the Wild, and there were many other things in it in those days besides goblins;
but he was well guided and well guarded-the wizard was with him, and Beorn for
much of the way-and he was never in great danger again. Anyway by mid-winter
Gandalf and Bilbo had come all the way back, along both edges of the Forest, to
the doors of Beorn's house; and there for a while they both stayed. Yule-tide
was warm and merry there; and men came from far and wide to feast at Beorn's
bidding. The goblins of the Misty Mountains were now few and terrified, and
hidden in the deepest holes they could find; and the Wargs had vanished from the
woods, so that men went abroad without fear. Beorn indeed became a great chief
afterwards in those regions and ruled a wide land between the mountains and the
wood; and it is said that for many generations the men of his line had the power
of taking bear's shape, and some were grim men and bad, but most were in heart
like Beorn, if less in size and strength. In their day the last goblins were
hunted from the Misty Mountains and a new peace came over the edge of the Wild.
It was spring, and a fair one with mild weathers and a bright sun, before Bilbo
and Gandalf took their leave at last of Beorn, and though he longed for home.
Bilbo left with regret, for the flowers of the gardens of Beorn were m
springtime no less marvellous than in high summer. At last they came up the long
road, and reached the very pass where the goblins had captured them before. But
they came to that high point at morning, and looking backward they saw a white
sun shining over the out-stretched lands. There behind lay Mirkwood, blue in the
distance, and darkly green at the nearer edge even in the spring. There far away
was the Lonely Mountain on the edge of eyesight. On its highest peak snow yet
unmelted was gleaming pale.</p>
<p>"So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending!"
said Bilbo, and he turned his back on his adventure. The Tookish part was
getting very tired, and the Baggins was daily getting stronger. "I wish now
only to be in my own arm-chair!" he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="19"></a></p>
<h2>Chapter 19</h2>
<h2>The Last Stage</h2>
<p>It was on May the First that the two came back at last to the brink of the
valley of Rivendell, where stood the Last (or the First) Homely House. Again it
was evening, their ponies were tired, especially the one that carried the
baggage; and they all felt in need of rest. As they rode down the steep path,
Bilbo heard the elves still singing in the trees, as if they had not stopped
since he left; and as soon as their riders came down into the lower glades of
the wood they burst into a song of much the same kind as before. This is
something like it:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The dragon is withered,</p>
<p>His bones are now crumbled;</p>
<p>His armour is shivered,</p>
<p>His splendour is humbled!</p>
<p>Though sword shall be rusted,</p>
<p>And throne and crown perish</p>
<p>With strength that men trusted</p>
<p>And wealth that they cherish,</p>
<p>Here grass is still growing,</p>
<p>And leaves are yet swinging,</p>
<p>The white water flowing,</p>
<p>And elves are yet singing</p>
<p>Come! Tra-la-la-lally!</p>
<p>Come back to the valley!</p>
<p>The stars are far brighter</p>
<p>Than gems without measure,</p>
<p>The moon is far whiter</p>
<p>Than silver in treasure:</p>
<p>The fire is more shining</p>
<p>On hearth in the gloaming</p>
<p>Than gold won by mining,</p>
<p>So why go a-roaming?</p>
<p>O! Tra-la-la-lally</p>
<p>Come back to the Valley.</p>
<p>O! Where are you going,</p>
<p>So late in returning?</p>
<p>The river is flowing,</p>
<p>The stars are all burning!</p>
<p>O! Whither so laden,</p>
<p>So sad and so dreary?</p>
<p>Here elf and elf-maiden</p>
<p>Now welcome the weary</p>
<p>With Tra-la-la-lally</p>
<p>Come back to the Valley,</p>
<p>Tra-la-la-lally</p>
<p>Fa-la-la-lally</p>
<p>Fa-la!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>Then the elves of the valley came out and greeted them and led them across
the water to the house of Elrond. There a warm welcome was made them, and there
were many eager ears that evening to hear the tale of their adventures. Gandalf
it was who spoke, for Bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy. Most of the tale he
knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told much of it to the wizard on
their homeward way or in the house of Beorn; but every now and again he would
open one eye, and listen, when a part of the story which he did not yet know
came in. It was in this way that he learned where Gandalf had been to; for he
overheard the words of the wizard to Elrond. It appeared that Gandalf had been
to a great council of the white wizards, masters of lore and good magic; and
that they had at last driven the Necromancer from his dark hold in the south of
Mirkwood.</p>
<p>"Ere long now," Gandalf was saying, "The Forest will grow
somewhat more wholesome. The North will be freed from that horror for many long
years, I hope. Yet I wish he were banished from the world!"</p>
<p>"It would be well indeed," said Elrond; "but I fear that will
not come about in this age of the world, or for many after."</p>
<p>When the tale of their journeyings was told, there were other tales, and yet
more tales, tales of long ago, and tales . of new things, and tales of no time
at all, till Bilbo's head fell forward on his chest, and he snored comfortably
in a corner.</p>
<p>He woke to find himself in a white bed, and the moon shining through an open
window. Below it many elves were singing loud and clear on the banks of the
stream.</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sing all ye joyful, now sing all together?</p>
<p>The wind's in the free-top, the wind's in the heather;</p>
<p>The stars are in blossom, the moon is in flower,</p>
<p>And bright are the windows of Night in her tower.</p>
<p>Dance all ye joyful, now dance all together!</p>
<p>Soft is the grass, and let foot be like feather!</p>
<p>The river is silver, the shadows are fleeting;</p>
<p>Merry is May-time, and merry our meeting.</p>
<p>Sing we now softly, and dreams let us weave him!</p>
<p>Wind him in slumber and there let us leave him!</p>
<p>The wanderer sleepeth. Now soft be his pillow!</p>
<p>Lullaby! Lullaby! Alder and Willow!</p>
<p>Sigh no more Pine, till the wind of the morn!</p>
<p>Fall Moon! Dark be the land!</p>
<p>Hush! Hush! Oak, Ash, and Thorn!</p>
<p>Hushed be all water, till dawn is at hand!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>"Well, Merry People!" said Bilbo looking out. "What time by
the moon is this? Your lullaby would waken a drunken goblin! Yet I thank
you."</p>
<p>"And your snores would waken a stone dragon - yet we thank you,"
they answered with laughter. "It is drawing towards dawn, and you have
slept now since the night's beginning. Tomorrow, perhaps, you will be cured of
weariness."</p>
<p>"A little sleep does a great cure in the house of Elrond," said he;
"but I will take all the cure I can get. A second good night, fair
friends!" And with that he went back to bed and slept till late morning.</p>
<p>Weariness fell from him soon in that house, and he had many a merry jest and
dance, early and late, with the elves of the valley. Yet even that place could
not long delay him now, and he thought always of his own home. After a week,
therefore, he said farewell to Elrond, and giving him such small gifts as he
would accept, he rode away with Gandalf. Even as they left the valley the sky
darkened in the West before them, and wind and rain came up to meet them.</p>
<p>"Merry is May-time!" said Bilbo, as the rain beat into his face.
"But our back is to legends and we are coming home. I suppose this is a
first taste of it."</p>
<p>"There is a long road yet," said Gandalf.</p>
<p>"But it is the last road," said Bilbo. They came to the river that
marked the very edge of the borderland of the Wild, and to the ford beneath the
steep bank, which you may remember. The water was swollen both with the melting
of the snows at the approach of summer, and with the daylong rain; but they
crossed with some difficulty, and pressed forward, as evening fell, on the last
stage of their journey. This was much as it had been before, except that the
company was smaller, and more silent; also this time there were no trolls. At
each point on the road Bilbo recalled the happenings and the words of a year
ago-it seemed to him more like ten-so that, of course, he quickly noted the
place where the pony had fallen in the river, and they had turned aside for
their nasty adventure with Tom and Bert and Bill. Not far from the road they
found the gold of the trolls, which they had buried, still hidden and untouched.
"I have enough to last me my time," said Bilbo, when they had dug it
up. "You had better take this, Gandalf. I daresay you can find a use for
it."</p>
<p>"Indeed I can!" said the wizard. "But share and share alike!
You may find you have more needs than you expect."</p>
<p>So they put the gold in bags and slung them on the ponies, who were not at
all pleased about it. After that their going was slower, for most of the time
they walked. But the land was green and there was much grass through which the
hobbit strolled along contentedly. He mopped his face with a red silk
handkerchief-no! not a single one of his own had survived, he had borrowed this
one from Elrond -for now June had brought summer, and the weather was bright and
hot again.</p>
<p>As all things come to an end, even this story, a day came at last when they
were in sight of the country where Bilbo had been born and bred, where the
shapes of the land and of the trees were as well known to him as his hands and
toes. Coming to a rise he could see his own Hill in the distance, and he stopped
suddenly and said:</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Roads go ever ever on,</p>
<p>Over rock and under tree,</p>
<p>By caves where never sun has shone,</p>
<p>By streams that never find the sea;</p>
<p>Over snow by winter sown,</p>
<p>And through the merry flowers of June,</p>
<p>Over grass and over stone,</p>
<p>And under mountains in the moon.</p>
<p>Roads go ever ever on</p>
<p>Under cloud and under star,</p>
<p>Yet feet that wandering have gone</p>
<p>Turn at last to home afar.</p>
<p>Eyes that fire and sword have seen</p>
<p>And horror in the halls of stone</p>
<p>Look at last on meadows green</p>
<p>And trees and hills they long have known.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>Gandalf looked at him. "My dear Bilbo!" he said. "Something is
the matter with you! You are not the hobbit that you were."</p>
<p>And so they crossed the bridge and passed the mill by the river and came
right back to Bilbo's own door. "Bless me! What's going on?" he cried.
There was a great commotion, and people of all sorts, respectable and
unrespectable, were thick round the door, and many were going in and out-not
even wiping their feet on the mat, as Bilbo noticed with annoyance.</p>
<p>If he was surprised, they were more surprised still. He had arrived back in
the middle of an auction! There was a large notice in black and red hung on the
gate, stating that on June the Twenty-second Messrs. Grubb, Grubb, and Bun-owes
would sell by auction the effects of the late Bilbo Baggins Esquire, of Bag-End,
Underhill, Hobbiton. Sale to commence at ten o'clock sharp. It was now nearly
lunch-time, and most of the things had already been sold, for various prices
from next to nothing to old songs (as is not unusual at auctions). Bilbo's
cousins the Sackville-Bagginses were, in fact, busy measuring his rooms to see
if their own furniture would fit. In short Bilbo was "Presumed Dead,"
and not everybody that said so was sorry to find the presumption wrong.</p>
<p>The return of Mr. Bilbo Baggins created quite a disturbance, both under the
Hill and over the Hill, and across the Water; it was a great deal more than a
nine days' wonder. The legal bother, indeed, lasted for years. It was quite a
long time before Mr. Baggins was in fact admitted to be alive again. The people
who had got specially good bargains at the Sale took a deal of convincing; and
in the end to save time Bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of his own furniture.
Many of his silver spoons mysteriously disappeared and were never accounted for.
Personally he suspected the Sackville-Bagginses. On their side they never
admitted that the returned Baggins was genuine, and they were not on friendly
terms with Bilbo ever after. They really had wanted to live in his nice
hobbit-hole so very much.</p>
<p>Indeed Bilbo found he had lost more than spoons - he had lost his reputation.
It is true that for ever after he remained an elf-friend, and had the honour of
dwarves, wizards, and all such folk as ever passed that way; but he was no
longer quite respectable. He was in fact held by all the hobbits of the
neighbourhood to be 'queer'-except by his nephews and nieces on the Took side,
but even they were not encouraged in their friendship by their elders. I am
sorry to say he did not mind. He was quite content; and the sound of the kettle
on his hearth was ever after more musical than it had been even in the quiet
days before the Unexpected Party. His sword he hung over the mantelpiece. His
coat of mail was arranged on a stand in the hall (until he lent it to a Museum).
His gold and silver was largely spent in presents, both useful and extravagant -
which to a certain extent accounts for the affection of his nephews and his
nieces. His magic ring he kept a great secret, for he chiefly used it when
unpleasant callers came. He took to writing poetry and visiting the elves; and
though many shook their heads and touched their foreheads and said "Poor
old Baggins!" and though few believed any of his tales, he remained very
happy to the end of his days, and those were extraordinarily long.</p>
<p>One autumn evening some years afterwards Bilbo was sitting in his study
writing his memoirs - he thought of calling them "There and Back Again, a
Hobbit's Holiday" - when there was a ring at the door. It was Gandalf and a
dwarf; and the dwarf was actually Balin.</p>
<p>"Come in! Come in!" said Bilbo, and soon they were settled in
chairs by the fire. If Balin noticed that Mr. Baggins' waistcoat was more
extensive (and had real gold buttons), Bilbo also noticed that Balm's beard was
several inches longer, and his jewelled belt was of great magnificence.</p>
<p>They fell to talking of their times together, of course, and Bilbo asked how
things were going in the lands of the Mountain. It seemed they were going very
well. Bard had rebuilt the town in Dale and men had gathered to him from the
Lake and from South and West, and all the valley had become tilled again and
rich, and the desolation was now filled with birds and blossoms in spring and
fruit and feasting in autumn. And Lake-town was refounded and was more
prosperous than ever, and much wealth went up and down the Running River; and
there was friendship in those parts between elves and dwarves and men.</p>
<p>The old Master had come to a bad end. Bard had given him much gold for the
help of the Lake-people, but being of the kind that easily catches such disease
he fell under the dragon-sickness, and took most of the gold and fled with it,
and died of starvation in the Waste, deserted by his companions.</p>
<p>"The new Master is of wiser kind," said Balin, "and very
popular, for, of course, he gets most of the credit for the present prosperity.
They are making songs which say that in his day the rivers run with gold."</p>
<p>"Then the prophecies of the old songs have turned out to be true, after
a fashion!" said Bilbo.</p>
<p>"Of course!" said Gandalf. "And why should not they prove
true? Surely you don't disbelieve the prophecies, because you had a hand in
bringing them about yourself? You don't really suppose, do you, that all your
adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck, just for your sole benefit?
You are a very fine person, Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you are
only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all!"</p>
<p>"Thank goodness!" said Bilbo laughing, and handed him the
tobacco-jar.</p>
